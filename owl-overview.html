    <title>William A. Martin's OWL System</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>OWL: the original</h1>
    <p>In the early 1970's, Prof. <b>William A. (Bill) Martin</b> of
      MIT's Project MAC (later the Lab for Computer Science) began
      development of a powerful knowledge representation language called
      OWL.&nbsp; Although the acronym was never officially defined, many
      of us who participated in the project believed it to stand for "<b>O</b>ne
      <b>W</b>orld <b>
        L</b>anguage." Throughout several incarnations, OWL was used to
      support research on</p>
    <ul>
      <li>automatic programming (including declarative specification of
        computational procedures)</li>
      <li>natural language understanding</li>
      <li>business modeling and problem solving</li>
      <li>medical diagnosis and therapy management</li>
      <li>generation of natural language explanations from knowledge and
        program behavior</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The heart of the system is a formal language for knowledge
      representation that took a Wittgenstein-like approach to
      knowledge.&nbsp; Approximately, this says that the meaning of any
      <i>concept</i> in the language is the totality of all the other
      concepts linked to it. Concepts were formed by <i>specialization</i>,
      OWL included a <i>derivative subclassifier</i> that made certain
      taxonomic inferences, and a very general notion of <i>characterization</i>
      allowed great flexibility in expressing assertional
      knowledge.&nbsp; Critically, all characterizations could be <i>reified</i>
      as concepts, allowing the system to use meta-level descriptions of
      its own features.&nbsp; Inference methods could be specified
      within the language itself, or could be implemented as Lisp
      procedures for efficiency.</p>
    <p>Bill unfortunately became gravely ill in 1980, and died in
      1981.&nbsp; As a result, the OWL group dispersed to other
      institutions and research efforts, and development on OWL itself
      ceased.&nbsp; Details of OWL were not fully published, but
      [Szol87] gives a comprehensive overview of the system and [Hawk85]
      describes the classifer.&nbsp; [Mart81] is an incomplete draft of
      a book Bill was writing describing his insights into the subtle
      but profound relationships between knowledge representation and
      structure and metaphors in natural language.&nbsp; The other
      references below show uses of OWL in various research projects and
      thus shed additional light on its capabilities.</p>
    <h1>OWL for the Semantic Web</h1>
    <p>In 2002, I was asked if the name OWL could be re-used for a new
      formal knowledge representation language in support of the
      Semantic Web, based on a modern implementation of a description
      logic such as DAML+OIL.&nbsp; I believe this is a highly fitting
      tribute to Bill's pioneering work in knowledge representation.</p>

      <p>This memo reflects a time slice in OWL development. Some of the
        constructs and concept classes assumed to exist show sign of
        obsolescence, and some new classes and constructs will probably
        be introduced. References to &lt;Martin 1975&gt; are to a August
        4, 1975 draft (along with WWORLD &gt; of August 15) and do not
        necessarlly reflect hls current thinking or thc for~ of the
        final vcrsion. Simllarly, references to the OWL i~ple~entation
        reflect ny understanding of its state prlor to August 1, 1975. I

      <p>OWL II is a language for knowledge representation under
        development at the MlT Laboratory for Computer Science
        [Szolovits, et al., 1977]. OWL II is based on the Linguistic
        Memory System (LMS) developed by Hawkinson (1975). A guiding
        principle of the language is that it should mimic the knowledge
        representation conventions of English speakers to the extent
        that theories of these conventions can be developed. In [Martin,
        1978], I established basic conventions for the construction of
        representation heirarchies in OWL II. In this paper, I go on to
        establish conventions for the construction of descriptions which
        correspond to English words, phrases, and sentences.</p>
      <p>In OWL II, we take the view [Vygotsky (1962), Whorf (1956)]
        that language provides a framework for the organization of
        knowledge. This paper discusses properties which are frequently
        attributed to such frameworks. A set of primitives and
        operations by which such frameworks can be generated is
        suggested.</p>
      <p>Further embellished, such frameworks underly the proposed
        representation of English words, phrases, and sentences.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Let S be the set of rational exponential expressions with
        complex rational coefficients, single level exponentiation, and
        no division or element i in the exponents. Let p be a prime
        integer of the form 4q+1, where q is also prime. The expressions
        in S can be matched for algebraic equivalence by substituting
        random integer values for the variables, evaluating the
        exponents mod (p—1), and evaluating the rational expressions mod
        p. When this is done equivalent expressions will evaluate to the
        same result; while, in typical situations, two expressions
        selected at random will evaluate to the same result with
        probability about 1/q. Thus, if p is taken close to the word
        size of a 36-bit machine, the probability of matching equivalent
        expressions is 1 and the probability of random match is about
        10^-9. The problems of extending this scheme to allow division
        in the exponents and preserve the relation e^i-{pi}=—1 are
        studied. No solutions to these problems were found, but a scheme
        which handles some cases by special case checks is presented.
        This scheme was implemented in a program for algebraic
        simplification.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Finally going one step higher, we might consider networks whose
        primitive elements are language-specific. The only formalism
        that I know of at the current time that embodies this view is
        OWL, whose elements are expressions based on English. In such a
        formalism, one would presumably "...take seriously the Worfian
        hypothesis that a person's language plays a key role in
        determining his model of the world and thus in structuring his
        thought" [Martin 1977, p. 985]. In OWL, there is a basic
        concept-structuring scheme (see [Hawkinson 1975]) which is used
        to build expressions, and strictly speaking, the principles of
        "specialization", "attachment", and "reference" are the
        primitives of the language. However, these primitives are
        neutral enough to be considered implementational, and thus the
        knowledge itself can be considered to form the structure of the
        data base. This seems operationally reasonable when OWL is
        looked at in detail -- the two expressions, (HYDRANT FIRE) and
        (MAN FIRE), while both specialized by FIRE, can have the
        specializations "mean" different things based on the rest of the
        network structure. This linguistic level represents perhaps the
        most radical view of semantic nets, in that the "primitives" are
        language-dependent, and are expected to change in meaning as the
        network grows. Links in linguistic level networks stand for
        arbitrary relationships that exist in the world being
        represented.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Problems and possibilities for near term natural language query
        systems are discussed, with emphasis on the author's own system,
        EQS. First, the general objectives for near term systems in the
        areas of syntax, world knowledge, discourse, and problem solving
        are considered. Next, a comparison is made between the ATN
        parsing strategies In LADDER, ROBOT, PLANES, and EQS. Evidence
        for the importance of giving answers to queries not directly
        available In the data base is given together with some
        speculation on how the knowledge necessary for this might be
        acquired. After some general discussion of semantic data models,
        the semantic data model used in EQS is described, and the method
        used for building a semantic data model of an existing CODASYL
        data base is sketched. Lastly, the use of multiple levels of
        representation as a way to control complexity of such query
        systems is discussed.</p>

      <p>A scheme is proposed for representing the logical form of
        English sentences, wherein the meaning of a network node depends
        on how it is related through "role-in" links to nodes
        representing more aggregate entities. It is argued that roles
        are a natural device for capturing many linguistic and
        philosophic distinctions, and that they are convenient for
        computational processing. In particular, it is shown how role-in
        links may be advantageously used in lieu of quantifier scope to
        represent quantificational dependencies.</p>

      <p>Once a consultant has decided on an approach to the solution of
        a problem, he performs a feasibility analysis to verify that he
        has indeed found a solution. A good analysis usually requires
        the complete investigation of the client's firm. In practice,
        however, this investigation is seldom complete: only a few
        experts have a detailed knowledge of the factors that must be
        considered for an acceptable analysis.</p>
      <p>We have implemented a program to assist the Operations
        Management consultant in performing such feasibility analyses
        for procurement problems that do not involve distribution or
        production activities. The approach to the solution of a
        procurement problem is assumed to be the hierarchical framework
        for planning and control systems advocated by Hax and Meal. The
        program is based on a questionnaire (written by Arnoldo C. Hax)
        which is essentially a summary of the kinds of questions that
        should be asked when deciding whether the hierarchical framework
        is applicable.</p>
      <p>The program is implemented as an "unstructured" questionnaire
        that guides the user in investigating various aspects of a
        problem while giving him complete freedom in deciding how and
        when to supply answers to questions. It allows him to change and
        skip answers whenever he desires. The program makes use of the
        OWL data base, a linguistically based conceptual hierarchy, to
        represent procedures for the questionnaire and to store data
        accumulated during the interaction. This data representation
        makes possible the presentation in English of a problem
        description, various evaluations and the reasons for the
        evaluations.</p>
      <p>The system should prove useful to a consultant as a data
        gathering device, As an educational tool, it serves to
        illustrate the kind of information required for the successful
        analysis of a procurement problem.</p>

        27]) to the parsing of a difficult and wide ranging corpus of

        experiment which fooled businessmen users into thinking they
        were interacting with a computer, when they were actually
        interacting with Malhotra in another room. The sentences are
        given in Appendix I. The Malhotra corpus is considerably more
        difficult than a second collection given in Appendix II
        (originally published in [15]). Section 4 compares empirical
        results obtained from these collections against theoretical
        predictions.</p>
