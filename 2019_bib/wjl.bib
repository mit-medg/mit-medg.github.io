	url = {https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23548405/},
	volume = 62,
	year = 2013,
	abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: As use of radiology studies increases, there is
               a concurrent increase in incidental findings (eg, lung nodules)
               for which the radiologist issues recommendations for additional
               imaging for follow-up. Busy emergency physicians may be
               challenged to carefully communicate recommendations for
               additional imaging not relevant to the patient's primary
               evaluation. The emergence of electronic health records and
               natural language processing algorithms may help address this
               quality gap. We seek to describe recommendations for additional
               imaging from our institution and develop and validate an
               automated natural language processing algorithm to reliably
               identify recommendations for additional imaging. METHODS: We
               developed a natural language processing algorithm to detect
               recommendations for additional imaging, using 3 iterative cycles
               of training and validation. The third cycle used 3,235 radiology
               reports (1,600 for algorithm training and 1,635 for validation)
               of discharged emergency department (ED) patients from which we
               determined the incidence of discharge-relevant recommendations
               for additional imaging and the frequency of appropriate
               discharge documentation. The test characteristics of the 3
               natural language processing algorithm iterations were compared,
               using blinded chart review as the criterion standard. RESULTS:
               Discharge-relevant recommendations for additional imaging were
               found in 4.5\% (95\% confidence interval [CI] 3.5\% to 5.5\%) of
               ED radiology reports, but 51\% (95\% CI 43\% to 59\%) of
               discharge instructions failed to note those findings. The final
               natural language processing algorithm had 89\% (95\% CI 82\% to
               94\%) sensitivity and 98\% (95\% CI 97\% to 98\%) specificity
               for detecting recommendations for additional imaging. For
               discharge-relevant recommendations for additional imaging,
               sensitivity improved to 97\% (95\% CI 89\% to 100\%).
               CONCLUSION: Recommendations for additional imaging are common,
               and failure to document relevant recommendations for additional
               imaging in ED discharge instructions occurs frequently. The
               natural language processing algorithm's performance improved
               with each iteration and offers a promising error-prevention
               tool.},

              notes on classification accuracy for resuscitation code status.
              Data was extracted from the MIMICII database. Natural language
              processing (NLP) was used to evaluate the social section of the
              nurses' progress notes. BoosTexter was used to predict the
              code-status using notes, age, gender, and Simplified Acute
              Physiology Score (SAPS). The relative impact of features was
              analyzed by feature ablation. Unstructured notes were the
              greatest single indicator of code status. The addition of text to
              medical condition features increased classification accuracy
              significantly (phusband.) Logistic regression on structured
              features was used determine gender bias or ageism. Evidence of
              bias was found; both females (OR=1.45) and patients over age 70
              (OR=3.72) were more likely to be Do-Not-Resuscitate (DNR).},

               patients and caregivers. This work presents a first step towards
               automatic analysis and summarization of spoken medical dialogue.
               We first abstract a dialogue into a sequence of semantic
               categories using linguistic and contextual features integrated
               in a supervised machine-learning framework. Our model has a
               classification accuracy of 73\%, compared to 33\% achieved by a
               majority baseline (p<0.01). We then describe and implement a
               summarizer that utilizes this automatically induced structure.
               Our evaluation results indicate that automatically generated
               summaries exhibit high resemblance to summaries written by
               humans. In addition, task-based evaluation shows that physicians
               can reasonably answer questions related to patient care by
               looking at the automatically generated summaries alone, in
               contrast to the physicians' performance when they were given
               summaries from a naïve summarizer (p<0.05). This work
               demonstrates the feasibility of automatically structuring and
               summarizing spoken medical dialogue.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: The Heart Disease Program (HDP) is a novel computerized
              diagnosis program incorporating a computer model of
              cardiovascular physiology. Physicians can enter standard clinical
              data and receive a differential diagnosis with explanations.
              OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic performance of the HDP and
              its usability by physicians in a typical clinical setting.
              DESIGN: A prospective observational study of the HDP in use by
              physicians in departments of medicine and cardiology of a
              teaching hospital. Data came from 114 patients with a broad range
              of cardiac disorders, entered by six physicians. MEASUREMENTS:
              Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV).
              Comprehensiveness: the proportion of final diagnoses suggested by
              the HDP or physicians for each case. RELEVANCE: the proportion of
              HDP or physicians' diagnoses that are correct. Area under the
              receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the HDP
              and the physicians. Performance was compared with a final
              diagnosis based on follow-up and further investigations. RESULTS:
              Compared with the final diagnoses, the HDP had a higher
              sensitivity (53.0\% vs. 34.8\%) and significantly higher
              comprehensiveness (57.2\% vs. 39.5\%, p < 0.0001) than the
              physicians. Physicians' PPV and relevance (56.2\%, 56.0\%) were
              higher than the HDP (25.4\%, 28.1\%). Combining the diagnoses of
              the physicians and the HDPs, sensitivity was 61.3\% and
              comprehensiveness was 65.7\%. These findings were significant in
              the two collection cohorts and for subanalysis of the most
              serious diagnoses. The AUCs were similar for the HDP and the
              physicians. CONCLUSIONS: The heart disease program has the
              potential to improve the differential diagnoses of physicians in
              a typical clinical setting.},
