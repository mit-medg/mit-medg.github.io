    <h1 class="style1">Graduate Admissions in (Bio-)Medical Informatics</h1>
    <p>Many foreign (and some domestic) applicants are under the
      impression that one should apply to individual research labs or
      professors to join graduate programs. However, in most US
      universities the admission decision is delegated to a
      department-wide admissions committee, and the only way to be
      admitted to graduate study is by applying to that process,
      normally by early December. Only as the last step of admissions
      (around February or March each year) do we try to match the admitted students'
      research interests to opportunities within individual research
      groups, often influenced not only by sharing of common research
      interests but also availability of RA (Research Assistant) and
      Fellowship funding and spots opened up by recent graduates.</p>
    <p>The MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
      (EECS) has a long tradition of encouraging studies in highly
      varied fields, and has provided opportunities for nearly fifty
      years for doctoral studies in medical informatics. Since the
      advent of biomedical informatics as a field in the 1990's, it has
      also served as one of the appropriate places to study this field.
      Information on applying for admission to EECS may be found at <a
href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/"
        moz-do-not-send="true"><code>https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/graduate-programs/admission-process/</code></a><code></code>,
      and the application site is linked from there.<br/>
      Note that, although EECS expects students to earn a master's
      degree on the way to a PhD, there is no terminal master's program,
      and candidates interested only in obtaining a master's degree
      compete for admission with those planning to study for the PhD. </p>
    <p> Harvard/MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology (HST),
      which is part of MIT's <a href="http://imes.mit.edu">Institute
        for Medical Engineering and Science</a>, also offers PhD
      programs in biomedical engineering/physics (MEMP). Information is
      at
      <a href="https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp"><code>https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp</code></a></p>
    <p>MIT also hosts a Computational and Systems Biology (CSBi)
      doctoral program, described at<br>
      <a href="https://csbphd.mit.edu"><code>https://csbphd.mit.edu</code></a></p>
    <p><a href="https://idss.mit.edu">The Institute for Data, Systems
        and Society</a> at MIT focuses on large-scale socio-technical
      problems in various engineering areas, and has been developing an
      interest in the healthcare system as a whole. Their doctoral
      program is described at<br>
      <a href="http://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/"><code>http://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/</code></a></p>
    <p>If you already have an MD or other doctoral degree in a
      health-related field, we collaborate with a Master's program in
      biomedical informatics hosted by Harvard Medical School. The
      program also normally includes association with one of the
      Boston-area hospitals' informatics laboratories. They also have
      PhD programs in Bioinformatics and Integrative Genomics and in Artificial Intelligence in Medicine.
      Information on these programs is at
      <a href="http://informaticstraining.hms.harvard.edu/">http://informaticstraining.hms.harvard.edu/</a></p>
    <p>A more general discussion of educational opportunities within the
      MIT CSAIL Clinical Decision Making Group is at
      <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/training/index.html">http://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/training/index.html</a></p>
    <p>Although the range of options seems overwhelming, there is
      significant overlap among the classes, faculty and labs involved
      in many of these programs. Though the admission process may look
      disjointed, the educational process is better integrated!<br>
    </p>
    <p>Applicants should be aware that admission to these programs is
      highly competitive, so even most fully qualified students are not
      admitted simply because we are unable to educate so many good
      students.&nbsp; Therefore, it is imperative for anyone seeking a
      graduate education in this field to look broadly at many available
      programs around the US and the world and to apply to ones that
      seem a good match to his or her interests. This maximizes the
      chances of admission to some good program, despite the significant
      random component of admission committee decisions.<br>
    </p>
    <p>My colleagues in EECS have created a set of hints about the kinds
      of evidence of likely success that they are looking for when
      reading applications. You may want to look through these <a

    </p>
<p>
I have completed fifty years of teaching at MIT and am approaching retirement. Therefore, I have stopped taking on
new doctoral students. Fortunately, I now have many other faculty colleagues with interests that overlap mine, so students
interested in working in my research group can find very comparable opportunities in other groups. For example, 
the EECS web page describing <a href="https://www.eecs.mit.edu/research/explore-all-research-areas/ml-and-healthcare/">
AI for Healthcare and Life Sciences</a> gives an overview of Department activities in this field.
