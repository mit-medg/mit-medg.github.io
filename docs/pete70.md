As a former student or colleague of Pete Szolovits, we’d like to invite you to a conference in honor of his 70th birthday. Pete has had a huge impact both on the field and on all of us, and that's something worth celebrating. We hope you can join us at this event to celebrate Pete, meet your extended academic family, and learn what everyone is working on — and, of course, hear some great stories about Pete!

A celebration of Professor Peter Szolovits of MIT's CSAIL is taking place on Monday, Dec. 2nd, 2019, from 9:00 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. at the Waterhouse Room in Gordon Hall at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Please let us know if you are able to attend via the following [RSVP form](https://forms.gle/MpeNJVytMaZphyPv9) and we hope to see you there! 

All the Best,

Marzyeh, Matthew, Emily, Tristan, Willie
(and a collection of Pete’s current and former students)
