	abstract = {Background: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common bacterial infections globally, leading to significant healthcare expenditures and frequent misdiagnoses. In the United States, UTIs account for approximately 380,600 preventable adult inpatient stays annually, costing \$2.55 billion ({\texteuro} 2.26 billion). Current Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are often static, lack personalized recommendations, and do not incorporate real-time clinician feedback. AI (alternative)-driven CDSS, leveraging large language models, offers the potential to enhance diagnostic precision, optimize antibiotic use, and improve workflow efficiency. Methods: We propose automatic photographic apparatus (3RDI), a conceptual framework for an AI-driven CDSS for UTI management, utilizing the novel DETNQ (Diagnosis, Evidence, Treatment Plan, Notes, Quality) structure to organize clinical outputs. This framework envisions a system that would process comprehensive patient data, including medical history, symptoms, laboratory results, and medication records. 3RDI's design incorporates a day-wise iterative process for continuous feedback, allowing clinicians to refine the system's recommendations and establish a collaborative human-AI decision-making environment.},

	abstract = {Customer churn prediction has become crucial for businesses, yet it poses significant challenges regarding privacy preservation and prediction accuracy. In this paper, we address two fundamental questions: (1) How can customer churn be effectively predicted while ensuring robust privacy protection of sensitive data? (2) How can large language models enhance churn prediction accuracy while maintaining data privacy? To address these questions, we propose FairRAG, a robust architecture that combines differential privacy, retrieval-augmented generation, and LLMs. Our approach leverages OPT-125M as the core language model along with a sentence transformer for semantic similarity matching while incorporating differential privacy mechanisms to generate synthetic training data. We evaluate FairRAG on two diverse datasets: Bank Churn and Telco Churn. The results demonstrate significant improvements over both traditional machine learning approaches and standalone LLMs, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 11\% on the Bank Churn dataset and 12\% on the Telco Churn dataset. These improvements were maintained when using differentially private synthetic data, thus indicating robust privacy and accuracy trade-offs.},

	abstract = {In the era of data-driven decision-making, ensuring fairness and equality in machine learning models has become increasingly crucial. Multiple fairness definitions have been brought forward to evaluate and mitigate unintended fairness-related harms in real-world applications, with little research on addressing their interactions with each other. This paper explores the application of a Minimax Pareto-optimized solution to optimize individual and group fairness at individual and group levels on the Adult Census Income dataset as well as on the German Credit dataset. The objective of training a classification model with a multi-objective loss function is to achieve fair outcomes without compromising utility objectives. We investigate the interplay of different fairness definitions, including definitions of performance consistency and traditional group and individual fairness measures, amongst each other coupled with performance. The results presented in this paper highlight the feasibility of incorporating several fairness considerations into machine learning models, which can be applied to use cases with multiple sensitive features and attributes that characterize real-world applications. This research is a valuable step toward building responsible and transparent machine learning systems that can be incorporated into critical decisionmaking processes.},

	abstract = {Deepfake images, synthetic images created using digital software, continue to present a serious threat to online platforms. This is especially relevant for biometric verification systems, as deepfakes that attempt to bypass such measures increase the risk of impersonation, identity theft and scams. Although research on deepfake image detection has provided many high-performing classifiers, many of these commonly used detection models lack generalizability across different methods of deepfake generation. For companies and governments fighting identify fraud, a lack of generalization is challenging, as malicious actors may use a variety of deepfake image-generation methods available through online wrappers. This work explores if combining multiple classifiers into an ensemble model can improve generalization without losing performance across different generation methods. It also considers current methods of deepfake image generation, with a focus on publicly available and easily accessible methods. We compare our framework against its underlying models to show how companies can better respond to emerging deepfake generation methods.},
