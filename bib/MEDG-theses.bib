	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Language technology has become pervasive in everyday life. Neural networks are a key component in this technology thanks to their ability to model large amounts of data. Contrary to traditional systems, models based on deep neural networks (a.k.a. deep learning) can be trained in an end-to-end fashion on input-output pairs, such as a sentence in one language and its translation in another language, or a speech utterance and its transcription. The end-to-end training paradigm simplifies the engineering process while giving the model flexibility to optimize for the desired task. This, however, often comes at the expense of model interpretability: understanding the role of different parts of the deep neural network is difficult, and such models are sometimes perceived as "black-box", hindering research efforts and limiting their utility to society. This thesis investigates what kind of linguistic information is represented in deep learning models for written and spoken language. In order to study this question, I develop a unified methodology for evaluating internal representations in neural networks, consisting of three steps: training a model on a complex end-to-end task; generating feature representations from different parts of the trained model; and training classifiers on simple supervised learning tasks using the representations. I demonstrate the approach on two core tasks in human language technology: machine translation and speech recognition. I perform a battery of experiments comparing different layers, modules, and architectures in end-to-end models that are trained on these tasks, and evaluate their quality at different linguistic levels. First, I study how neural machine translation models learn morphological information. Second, I compare lexical semantic and part-of-speech information in neural machine translation. Third, I investigate where syntactic and semantic structures are captured in these models. Finally, I explore how end-to-end automatic speech recognition models encode phonetic information. The analyses illuminate the inner workings of end-to-end machine translation and speech recognition systems, explain how they capture different language properties, and suggest potential directions for improving them. I also point to open questions concerning the representation of other linguistic properties, the investigation of different models, and the use of other analysis methods. Taken together, this thesis provides a comprehensive analysis of internal language representations in deep learning models.},

	abstract = {How do people learn a second language? In this thesis, we study this question through an examination of cross-linguistic transfer: the role of a speaker's native language in the acquisition, representation, usage and processing of a second language. We present a computational framework that enables studying transfer in a unified fashion across language production and language comprehension. Our framework supports bidirectional inference between linguistic characteristics of speakers' native languages, and the way they use and process a new language. We leverage this inference ability to demonstrate the systematic nature of cross-linguistic transfer, and to uncover some of its key linguistic and cognitive manifestations. We instantiate our framework in language production by relating syntactic usage patterns and grammatical errors in English as a Second Language (ESL) to typological properties of the native language, showing its utility for automated typology learning and prediction of second language grammatical errors. We then introduce eye tracking during reading as a methodology for studying cross-linguistic transfer in second language comprehension. Using this methodology, we demonstrate that learners' native language can be predicted from their eye movement while reading free-form second language text. Further, we show that language processing during second language comprehension is intimately related to linguistic characteristics of the reader's first language. Finally, we introduce the Treebank of Learner English (TLE), the first syntactically annotated corpus of learner English. The TLE is annotated with Universal Dependencies (UD), a framework geared towards multilingual language analysis, and will support linguistic and computational research on learner language. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of multilingual approaches to the scientific study of second language acquisition, and to Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications for non-native language.},

	abstract = {Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) patients in resource-poor settings experience large delays in starting appropriate drug regimens and are often not monitored appropriately due to an overburdened health care system, communication delays, and missing or error-prone data. Medical information systems can be used to alleviate these problems by increasing the timeliness and quality of laboratory information available. The research reported in this thesis developed, implemented, and evaluated two such systems in the urban, resource-poor setting of Lima, Peru in institutions with and without internet. The first part addresses the electronic collection of tuberculosis (TB) laboratory information from multiple institutions without internet. A handheld computer-based system was developed and implemented. A cluster randomized controlled trial and before-and-after comparison showed that this system had a significant effect in reducing processing times from 23 to 8 days, the proportion of cultures with delays >90 days from 9.2\% to 0.1\%, the number of errors by 57.1\%, and the work-hours necessary to process results by 60\%. A cost and timeline framework was developed to allow other organizations in resource-poor settings to implement this technology. The second part addresses a web-based system, e-Chasqui, developed to provide electronic communication and reporting of TB laboratory information to health care personnel within institutions with internet. A cluster randomized controlled trial showed that access to e-Chasqui resulted in significantly less time to receipt of test results, a 56\% reduction in tests taking over 60 days to arrive and a 98\% reduction of results that never arrived, as well as a significantly faster time to culture conversion among patients in intervention versus control centers.},

	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/54628},
	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Amyloids and prion proteins are clinically and biologically important beta-structures, whose supersecondary structures are difficult to determine by standard experimental or computational means. In addition, significant conformational heterogeneity is known or suspected to exist in many amyloid fibrils. Recent work has indicated the utility of templates and pairwise probabilistic statistics in betastructure prediction. A new suite of programs, BETASCAN, STITCHER, and HELIXCAP, are presented to address the problem of amyloid structure prediction. BETASCAN calculates likelihood scores for potential beta-strands and strand-pairs based on correlations observed in parallel beta-sheets. The program then determines the strands and pairs with the greatest local likelihood for all of the sequence's potential beta-structures. BETASCAN suggests multiple alternate folding patterns and assigns relative ab initio probabilities based solely on amino acid sequence, probability tables, and pre-chosen parameters. STITCHER processes the output of BETASCAN and uses dynamic programming to 'stitch' structures from flexible abstract templates defined by constraints for amyloid-like all-beta structures. The 'stitched' structures are evaluated by a free-energy-based scoring algorithm incorporating BETASCAN scores, bonuses for favorable side-chain stacking, and penalties for linker entropy. The analyses of STITCHER structures emphasize the importance of side-chain stacking ladders in amyloid formation. HELIXCAP detects a class of end-caps, called beta-helix caps, which stabilize known beta-helix structures. These structures are known to stabilize globular beta-helix proteins and prevent their amyloidogenesis; their presence in a sequence is a powerful negative predictor of amyloid potential. Together, these algorithms permit detection and structural analysis of protein amyloidogenicity from sequence data, enhancing the experimental investigation of amyloids and prion proteins.

	year = {2004},
	abstract = {Instead of focusing on the cell, or the genotype, or on any single measurement modality, using integrative biology allows us to think holistically and horizontally. A disease like diabetes can lead to myocardial infarction, nephropathy, and neuropathy; to study diabetes in genomic medicine would require reasoning from a disease to all its various complications to the genome and back. I am studying the process of intersecting nearly-comprehensive data sets in molecular biology, across three representative modalities (microarrays, RNAi and quantitative trait loci) out of the more than 30 available today. This is difficult because the semantics and context of each experiment performed becomes more important, necessitating a detailed knowledge about the biological domain. I addressed this problem by using all public microarray data from NIH, unifying 50 million expression measurements with standard gene identifiers and representing the experimental context of each using the Unified Medical Language System, a vocabulary of over 1 million concepts. I created an automated system to join data sets related by experimental context.
 
I evaluated this system by finding genes significantly involved in multiple experiments directly and indirectly related to diabetes and adipogenesis and found genes known to be involved in these diseases and processes. As a model first step into integrative biology, I then took known quantitative trait loci in the rat involved in glucose metabolism and build an expert system to explain possible biological mechanisms for these genetic data using the modeled genomic data. The system I have created can link diseases from the ICD-9 billing code level down to the genetic, genomic, and molecular level. In a sense, this is the first automated system built to study the new field of genomic medicine.

	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Mobile devices nowadays contain state-of-the-art technologies and are considered "smart". However, we and others around us are often interrupted or embarrassed by these smart devices because the calls and messages received by the devices are not always presented to us at the right moment with the appropriate modality. Our work investigates what information a device like this needs to know, and how the device should make use of such information in order to behave "politely". We began by investigating the human definition of "politeness" in the context of handling voice calls and text messages, and we found the common properties shared by the scenarios where a device is expected to behave politely. Next, we built a rulebased decision-making system that infers user interruptability and decides when and how the device should interrupt the user. We then determined whether the vocabulary defined in our rule set has captured general users' definition of a polite device. We also determined that users were able to understand the system's vocabulary and customize the rule set for their own needs. To further accommodate individual users' needs, we created a debugging interface that allows users to explore the rule set and modify the rules when the device "misbehaves". After that, we identified two major challenges in debugging: user's willingness to debug, displaying the structure of the rule set on a small screen real estate. Lastly, we pointed out the aspects that can be investigated in the future to improve our current work, including: augmenting the vocabulary when more signals become available, considering users of different use habits and cultural backgrounds, and designing a better interface that addresses the challenges in debugging.

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/87342},
	year = {2003},
	abstract = {The goal of the work reported here is to capture the commonsense knowledge of non-expert human contributors. Achieving this goal will enable more intelligent human-computer interfaces and pave the way for computers to reason about our world. In the domain of natural language processing, it will provide the world knowledge much needed for semantic processing of natural language. To acquire knowledge from contributors not trained in knowledge engineering, I take the following four steps: (i) develop a knowledge representation (KR) model for simple assertions in natural language, (ii) introduce cumulative analogy, a class of nearest-neighbor based analogical reasoning algorithms over this representation, (iii) argue that cumulative analogy is well suited for knowledge acquisition (KA) based on a theoretical analysis of effectiveness of KA with this approach, and (iv) test the KR model and the effectiveness of the cumulative analogy algorithms empirically. To investigate effectiveness of cumulative analogy for KA empirically, LEARNER, an open source system for KA by cumulative analogy has been implemented, deployed,1 and evaluated. LEARNER acquires assertion-level knowledge by constructing shallow semantic analogies between a KA topic and its nearest neighbors and posing these analogies as natural language questions to human contributors. Suppose, for example, that based on the knowledge about "newspapers" already present in the knowledge base, LEARNER judges "newspaper" to be similar to "book" and "magazine." Further suppose that assertions "books contain information" and "magazines contain information" are also already in the knowledge base. Then LEARNER will use cumulative analogy from the similar topics to ask humans whether "newspapers contain information."
 
Because similarity between topics is computed based on what is already known about them, LEARNER exhibits bootstrapping behavior - the quality of its questions improves as it gathers more knowledge.By summing evidence for and against posing any given question, LEARNER also exhibits noise tolerance, limiting the effect of incorrect similarities. The KA power of shallow semantic analogy from nearest neighbors is one of the main findings of this thesis. I perform an analysis of commonsense knowledge collected by another research effort that did not rely on analogical reasoning and demonstrate that indeed there is sufficient amount of correlation in the knowledge base to motivate using cumulative analogy from nearest neighbors as a KA method. Empirically, evaluating the percentages of questions answered affirmatively, negatively and judged to be nonsensical in the cumulative analogy case compares favorably with the baseline, no-similarity case that relies on random objects rather than nearest neighbors. Of the questions generated by cumulative analogy, contributors answered 45\% affirmatively, 28\% negatively and marked 13\% as nonsensical; in the control, no-similarity case 8\% of questions were answered affirmatively, 60\% negatively and 26\% were marked as nonsensical. 1The site, "1001 Questions," is publicly available at http://teach-computers.org/learner.html at the time of writing.

The basic approach explored is to view reasoning as a species of action, so that a program might apply its reasoning powers to the task of deciding what inferences to make as well as deciding what other actions to take. A design for the architecture of reasoning programs is proposed. This architecture involves self-consciousness, intentional actions, deliberate adaptations, and a form of decision-making based on dialectical argumentation. A program based on this architecture inspects itself, describes aspects of itself, and uses this self-reference and these self-descriptions in making decisions and taking actions. The program's mental life includes awareness of its own concepts, beliefs, desires, intentions, inferences, actions, and skills. All of these are represented by self-descriptions in a single sort of language, so that the program has access to all of these aspects of itself, and can reason about them in the same terms.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/71284},
	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Narrative structure is an ubiquitous and intriguing phenomenon. By virtue of structure we recognize the presence of Villainy or Revenge in a story, even if that word is not actually present in the text. Narrative structure is an anvil for forging new artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques, and is a window into abstraction and conceptual learning as well as into culture and its in influence on cognition. I advance our understanding of narrative structure by describing Analogical Story Merging (ASM), a new machine learning algorithm that can extract culturally-relevant plot patterns from sets of folktales. I demonstrate that ASM can learn a substantive portion of Vladimir Propp's in influential theory of the structure of folktale plots. The challenge was to take descriptions at one semantic level, namely, an event timeline as described in folktales, and abstract to the next higher level: structures such as Villainy, Stuggle- Victory, and Reward. ASM is based on Bayesian Model Merging, a technique for learning regular grammars. I demonstrate that, despite ASM's large search space, a carefully-tuned prior allows the algorithm to converge, and furthermore it reproduces Propp's categories with a chance-adjusted Rand index of 0.511 to 0.714. Three important categories are identied with F-measures above 0.8. The data are 15 Russian folktales, comprising 18,862 words, a subset of Propp's original tales. This subset was annotated for 18 aspects of meaning by 12 annotators using the Story Workbench, a general text-annotation tool I developed for this work. Each aspect was doubly-annotated and adjudicated at inter-annotator F-measures that cluster around 0.7 to 0.8. It is the largest, most deeply-annotated narrative corpus assembled to date. The work has significance far beyond folktales. First, it points the way toward important applications in many domains, including information retrieval, persuasion and negotiation, natural language understanding and generation, and computational creativity. Second, abstraction from natural language semantics is a skill that underlies many cognitive tasks, and so this work provides insight into those processes. Finally, the work opens the door to a computational understanding of cultural in influences on cognition and understanding cultural differences as captured in stories.},

	abstract = {The revolution of "Big Data" has reached various fields like marketing, healthcare, and criminology, where domain experts wish to find and understand interesting patterns from data. This thesis studies patterns that are defined by subsets of observations or subsets of features. The first part of the thesis studies patterns defined by subsets of observations. We look at a specific type of pattern, crime series (a set of crimes committed by the same individual or group) and develop two pattern detection algorithms. The first method is a sequential pattern building algorithm called Series Finder, which resembles how crime analysts process information instinctively and grows a crime series starting from a couple of seed crimes. The second method is a subspace clustering with cluster-specific feature selection, which is supervised when learning similarity graphs in order to reduce computation. Both methods we propose achieved promising results on a decade's worth of crime pattern data collected by the Crime Analysis Unit of the Cambridge Police Department. The second part of the thesis studies patterns defined by subsets of features. We develop methods and theory for building Rule Set models with the hallmark of interpretability. Interpretability is inherent in using association rules to explain predicted results. We first design two methods for building rule sets for binary classification. The first method Bayesian Rule Set (BRS) uses a Bayesian framework with priors that favor small models. The Bayesian priors also bring significant computational benefits to MAP inferences by reducing the search space and restraining the sampling chain within appropriate regions. We apply BRS models to an in-vehicle recommender system data set we collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk to study the customers and contexts that would encourage acceptance of coupons. We develop another model Optimized Rule Set (ORS) using optimization methods to directly construct rule sets from data, without pre-mining rules or discretizing continuous attributes. As a main application of ORS, we build a diagnostic screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea trained on data provided by the Sleep Lab at Mass General Hospital. Our models achieve high accuracy with a substantial gain in interpretability over other methods. Lastly, we build a Causal Rule Set (CRS) model for causal analysis, to identify subgroups that can benefit from a treatment. CRS combines BRS and Bayesian Logistic Regression. We take advantage of different strategies in inference algorithm to speed up computation. Simulations and experiments show that distributing treatment according to CRS models enhances average treatment effect.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/112453},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {I envision a future where intelligent service robots become integral members of human-robot teams in the workplace. Today, service robots are being deployed across a wide range of settings; however, while these robots exhibit basic navigational abilities, they lack the ability to anticipate and adapt to the needs of their human teammates. I believe robots must be capable of autonomously learning from humans how to integrate into a team ' la a human apprentice. Human domain experts and professionals become experts over years of apprenticeship, and this knowledge is not easily codified in the form of a policy. In my thesis, I develop a novel computational technique, Collaborative Optimization Via Apprenticeship Scheduling (COVAS), that enables robots to learn a policy to capture an expert's knowledge by observing the expert solve scheduling problems. COVAS can then leverage the policy to guide branch-and-bound search to provide globally optimal solutions faster than state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Developing an apprenticeship learning technique for scheduling is challenging because of the complexities of modeling and solving scheduling problems. Previously, researchers have sought to develop techniques to learn from human demonstration; however, these approaches have rarely been applied to scheduling because of the large number of states required to encode the possible permutations of the problem and relevant problem features (e.g., a job's deadlines, required resources, etc.). My thesis gives robots a novel ability to serve as teammates that can learn from and contribute to coordinating a human-robot team. The key to COVAS' ability to efficiently and optimally solve scheduling problems is the use of a novel policy-learning approach - apprenticeship scheduling - suited for imitating the method an expert uses to generate the schedule. This policy learning technique uses pairwise comparisons between the action taken by a human expert (e.g., schedule agent a to complete task [tau]i at time t) and each action not taken (e.g., unscheduled tasks at time t), at each moment in time, to learn the relevant model parameters and scheduling policies demonstrated in training examples provided by the human experts. I evaluate my technique in two real-world domains. First, I apply apprenticeship scheduling to the problem of anti-ship missile defense: protecting a naval vessel from an enemy attack by deploying decoys and countermeasures at the right place and time. I show that apprenticeship scheduling can learn to defend the ship, outperforming human experts on the majority of naval engagements (p < 0.011). Further, COVAS is able to produce globally optimal solutions an order of magnitude faster than traditional, state-of-the-art optimization techniques. Second, I apply apprenticeship scheduling to learn how to function as a resource nurse: the nurse in charge of ensuring the right patient is in the right type of room at the right time and that the right types of nurses are there to care for the patient. After training an apprentice scheduler on demonstrations given by resource nurses, I found that nurses and physicians agreed with the algorithm's advice 90\% of the time. Next, I conducted a series of human-subject experiments to understand the human factors consequences of embedding scheduling algorithms in robotic platforms. Through these experiments, I found that an embodied platform (i.e., a physical robot) engenders more appropriate trust and reliance in the system than an un-embodied one (i.e., computer-based system) when the scheduling algorithm works with human domain experts. However, I also found that increasing robot autonomy degrades human situational awareness. Further, there is a complex interplay between workload and workflow preferences that must be balanced to maximize team fluency. Based on these findings, I develop design guidelines for integrating service robots with autonomous decision-making capabilities into the human workplace.},

	abstract = {This thesis describes a methodology, a representation, and an implemented program for troubleshooting digital circuit boards at roughly the level of expertise one might expect in a human novice. Existing methods for model-based troubleshooting have not scaled up to deal with complex circuits, in part because traditional circuit models do not explicitly represent aspects of the device that troubleshooters would consider important. For complex devices the model of the target device should be constructed with the goal of troubleshooting explicitly in mind. Given that methodology, the principal contributions of the thesis are ways of representing complex circuits to help make troubleshooting feasible. Temporally coarse behavior descriptions are a particularly powerful simplification. Instantiating this idea for the circuit domain produces a vocabulary for describing digital signals. The vocabulary has a level of temporal detail sufficient to make useful predictions abut the response of the circuit while it remains coarse enough to make those predictions computationally tractable. Other contributions are principles for using these representations. Although not embodied in a program, these principles are sufficiently concrete that models can be constructed manually from existing circuit descriptions such as schematics, part specifications, and state diagrams. One such principle is that if there are components with particularly likely failure modes or failure modes in which their behavior is drastically simplified, this knowledge should be incorporated into the model. Further contributions include the solution of technical problems resulting from the use of explicit temporal representations and design descriptions with tangled hierarchies.},

	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/114002},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {Recent commitments to enhance the use of data for learning in medicine provide the opportunity to apply instruments and abstractions from computational learning theory to systematize learning in medicine. The hope is to accelerate the rate at which we incorporate knowledge and improve healthcare quality. In this thesis, we work to bring further clarity to the ways in which computational learning theory can be applied to update the collective knowledge about diseases. Researchers continually study and learn about the complex nature of the human body. They summarize this knowledge with the best possible set of diseases and how those diseases relate to each other. We draw on computational learning theory to understand and broaden this form of collective learning. This mode of collective learning is regarded as unsupervised learning, as no disease labels are initially available. In unsupervised learning, variance is typically reduced to find an optimal function to organize the data. A significant challenge that remains is how to measure variance in the definition of diseases in a comprehensive way. Variance in the definition of a disease introduces a systematic error in both basic and clinical research. If measured, it would also be possible to use computers to efficiently minimize variance, providing a great opportunity for learning by utilizing medical data. In this thesis, we demonstrate that it is possible to estimate variance in the disease taxonomy, effectively estimating an error bar for the current definitions of diseases. We do so using the history of the disease taxonomy and comparing it with a variety of external data sets that relate diseases to attributes such as symptoms, drugs and genes. We demonstrate that variance can be significant over relatively short time periods. We further present methods for updating the disease taxonomy by reducing variance based on external disease data sets. This makes it possible to automatically incorporate information contained in disease data sets into the disease taxonomy. The approach also makes it possible to use expert information encoded in the taxonomy to systematically transfer knowledge and update other biomedical data sets that are often sparse (e.g. - symptoms associated with diseases). A natural question stemming from these results is how granular does data need to be to make improvements? For instance, is patient-level data necessary to enable learning at the macro level of disease? Or are there strategies to extract information from other kinds of data to alleviate the need for very granular data. We show that detailed, patient-level data is not necessarily needed to extract detailed biological data. We do so by comparing disease relationships learned from clinical trial metadata to disease relationships learned from a detailed genetic database and show we can achieve similar results. This result shows that we can use currently available data and take advantage of computational learning to improve disease learning, which suggests a new avenue to improving patient outcomes. By reducing variance within diseases using data available today, we can quickly update the space of diseases to be more precise. Precise diseases lead to better learning in other areas of medicine and ultimately improved healthcare quality.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/111903},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {The amount of time series data collected in the medical community has recently been exploding due to widespread affordable sensors and storage devices. However, while the massive repositories of such physiological time series data provide enormous opportunities for machine learning to make significant impacts, they are largely under-utilized due to their granular detail, overwhelming size, and lack of proper tools. Besides scale, fast yet accurate processing of physiological waveform data is desired in medical practice, especially in time-critical settings such as the intensive care unit (ICU). Efficiently leveraging these massive datasets is a key challenge that, when resolved, will support a new paradigm of scientific discovery and operational innovation in medicine. In this thesis, we develop highly efficient similarity-based methods that make it practical to search massive physiological time series repositories to rapidly identify waveforms similar to those from a given individual. We call this concept ``patients with trajectories like mine.'' Our goal is to exploit rapid similar waveform retrieval to enable critical event prediction in the ICU setting. In order to achieve this goal, we propose to apply locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), which supports a very fast approximate nearest neighbor search in high dimensions. We empirically demonstrate that LSH based retrieval and prediction methods vastly speed up querying time while sacrificing only a trivial amount of accuracy as a cost. Despite being fast and accurate, the generic LSH has two shortcomings. First, it is capable of utilizing only one similarity measure at a time. To overcome this limit, we introduce Stratified LSH (SLSH) which finds similarity among the data from a more integrated perspective by employing multiple distance metrics in one framework. SLSH is essentially a dual-level hierarchical LSH where each LSH layer is associated with a distinct distance metric capturing a unique facet of similarity. The second shortcoming and the main bottleneck of the generic LSH is that it involves exhaustive distance calculations as a subroutine when short-listing the candidate set to find the final nearest neighbors. To surmount this, we propose Collision Frequency LSH (CFLSH) which short-lists the candidate set by simply counting the frequency of collision based on the key idea that the more frequently an element and a query collide across multiple LSH hash tables, the more similar they are. We show that with SLSH and CFLSH, we improve the efficiency of LSH in terms of both prediction accuracy and querying speed. We demonstrate our proposed methods on a mean arterial blood pressure dataset extracted from the MIMIC II database in the context of predicting acute hypotensive episodes in ICU. To examine the generality of our methods with respect to scaling, we validate our methods on datasets with various dimensions and item counts.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/34467},
	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Spoken medical dialogue is a valuable source of information, and it forms a foundation for diagnosis, prevention and therapeutic management. However, understanding even a perfect transcript of spoken dialogue is challenging for humans because of the lack of structure and the verbosity of dialogues. This work presents a first step towards automatic analysis of spoken medical dialogue. The backbone of our approach is an abstraction of a dialogue into a sequence of semantic categories. This abstraction uncovers structure in informal, verbose conversation between a caregiver and a patient, thereby facilitating automatic processing of dialogue content. Our method induces this structure based on a range of linguistic and contextual features that are integrated in a supervised machine-learning framework. Our model has a classification accuracy of 73\%, compared to 33\% achieved by a majority baseline (p<0.01). We demonstrate the utility of this structural abstraction by incorporating it into an automatic dialogue summarizer. Our evaluation results indicate that automatically generated summaries exhibit high resemblance to summaries written by humans and significantly outperform random selections (p<0.0001) in precision and recall.
 
In addition, task-based evaluation shows that physicians can reasonably answer questions related to patient care by looking at the automatically-generated summaries alone, in contrast to the physicians' performance when they were given summaries from a naive summarizer (p<0.05). This is a significant result because it spares the physician from the need to wade through irrelevant material ample in dialogue transcripts. This work demonstrates the feasibility of automatically structuring and summarizing spoken medical dialogue.},

Using teledermatology, one of the earliest and most widely adopted uses, a set of recommended performance metrics are established and a select few are evaluated across the different programs. Store and forward (SF) teledermatology, taking a picture and sending it to a dermatologist for asynchronous evaluation, is the prominent method of care. In SF programs there is variation in the level of follow-up care available locally. Some locations have "surrogate dermatology providers" that are trained to do basic treatments and procedures. Based on four site visits and twenty-five interviews with stakeholders, recommendations for performance measurements were created. VHA is already in the process of executing three of the measures nationally: image quality, time to consult response, and patient satisfaction. Additionally, VHA has the data available to measure time to treatment, post-teledermatology utilization of care, travel distance, and wait-times. Finally, VHA should improve data to create future metrics regarding: cost, particularly payment for outside dermatologists; provider satisfaction; and quality of care through chart review or adverse event reporting. Using administrative databases, the metrics for which data were available were retrospectively evaluated. At a national level for 2013, entry into the care process through teledermatology is associated with faster time to treatment than entry from an in-person referral for both melanoma (teledermatology median: 62 days; in-person consult median: 70 days; p=0.002) and non-melanoma skin cancer (teledermatology median: 79 days; in-person consult median: 88 days; p<0.001). There was little consistency in the post-teledermatology care utilized across programs. Testing three programs with different resources used for local follow-up care, travel distance saved over 2013 was calculated. The program with surrogate dermatology providers had the most travel saved per patient. Implementation of teledermatology had no statistically significant impact on in-person wait times for dermatology clinics.},

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a shift in the psychological research literature from an emphasis on dysfunction to a focus on well-being and positive mental health. As a result, enhancing well-being in individuals has become a viable approach to improving health, in addition to treating disorders when present. Also, the availability of rich multi-modal datasets and advances in machine learning methods have spurred an increase in research studies assessing well-being objectively. However, most of these studies tend to primarily focus on using data to estimate or detect the current state of well-being as opposed to the prediction of well-being. In addition, these studies investigate how stand-alone health behaviors and not a combination of health behaviors influence well-being. Furthermore, these studies do not provide data-backed insights and recommendations to individuals seeking to improve their well-being. In this dissertation, we use a real-world dataset from a population of college students and interpretable machine learning methods to (1) predict future mood, stress and health, (2) uncover how combinations of health behaviors work together to influence well-being, and (3) understand how to make evidence-based recommendations to individuals looking to improve their well-being. The use of these methods contributes to the development of objective techniques that can help individuals monitor their wellbeing. In addition, insights from this study contribute to knowledge advancement on how combinations of daily human behaviors can affect well-being.},

	year = {2011},
	abstract = {Modern computational biology is awash in large-scale data mining problems. Several high-throughput technologies have been developed that enable us, with relative ease and little expense, to evaluate the coordinated expression levels of tens of thousands of genes, evaluate hundreds of thousands of single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and sequence individual genomes. The data produced by these assays has provided the research and commercial communities with the opportunity to derive improved clinical prognostic indicators, as well as develop an understanding, at the molecular level, of the systemic underpinnings of a variety of diseases. Aside from the statistical methods used to evaluate these assays, another, more subtle challenge is emerging. Despite the explosive growth in the amount of data being generated and submitted to the various publicly available data repositories, very little attention has been paid to managing the phenotypic characterization of their samples (i.e., managing class labels in a controlled fashion). If sense is to be made of the underlying assay data, the samples' descriptive metadata must first be standardized in a machine-readable format. In this thesis, we explore these issues, specifically within the context of curating and analyzing a large DNA microarray database. We address three main challenges. First, we acquire a large subset of a publicly available microarray repository and develop a principled method for extracting phenotype information from freetext sample labels, then use that information to generate an index of the sample's medically-relevant annotation. The indexing method we develop, Concordia, incorporates pre-existing expert knowledge relating to the hierarchical relationships between medical terms, allowing queries of arbitrary specificity to be efficiently answered. Second, we describe a highly flexible approach to answering the question: "Given a previously unseen gene expression sample, how can we compute its similarity to all of the labeled samples in our database, and how can we utilize those similarity scores to predict the phenotype of the new sample?" Third, we describe a method for identifying phenotype-specific transcriptional profiles within the context of this database, and explore a method for measuring the relative strength of those signatures across the rest of the database, allowing us to identify molecular signatures that are shared across various tissues ad diseases. These shared fingerprints may form a quantitative basis for optimal therapy selection and drug repositioning for a variety of diseases.},

	abstract = {As intelligent environments (IEs) move from simple kiosks and meeting rooms into the everyday offices, kitchens, and living spaces we use, the need for these spaces to communicate not only with users, but also with each other, will become increasingly important. Users will want to be able to shift their work environment between localities easily, and will also need to communicate with others as they move about. These IEs will thus require two pieces of infrastructure: a knowledge representation (KR) which can keep track of people and their relationships to the world; and a communication mechanism so that the IE can mediate interactions. This thesis seeks to define, explore and evaluate one way of creating this infrastructure, by creating societies of agents that can act on behalf of real-world entities such as users, physical spaces, or informal groups of people. Just as users interact with each other and with objects in their physical location, the agent societies interact with each other along communication channels organized along these same relationships. By organizing the infrastructure through analogies to the real world, we hope to achieve a simpler conceptual model for the users, as well as a communication hierarchy which can be realized efficiently.

	abstract = {Identification of protein-protein interactions is important for drug design and the treatment of diseases. We propose a novel threading algorithm, LTHREADER, which generates accurate local sequence-structure alignments and integrates various statistical scores and experimental binding data to predict interactions. LTHREADER uses a profile of secondary structure and solvent accessibility predictions with residue contact maps to guide and constrain alignments. Using a decision tree classifier and low-throughput experimental data for training, it combines information inferred from statistical interaction potentials, energy functions, correlated mutations and conserved residue pairs to predict likely interactions. The significance of predicted interactions is evaluated using the scores for randomized binding surfaces within each family. We first apply our method to cytokines, which play a central role in the development of many diseases including cancer and inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. We tested our approach on two representative families from different structural classes (all-alpha and all-beta proteins) of cytokines. In comparison with the state-of-the-art threader RAPTOR, LTHREADER generates on average 20\% more accurate alignments of interacting residues and shows dramatic improvement in prediction accuracy over existing methods. To further improve alignment accuracy for all PPI families, we also introduce the program CMAPi, a two dimensional dynamic programming algorithm that, given a pair of protein complexes, optimally aligns the contact maps of their interfaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm on complexes from PPI families listed in the SCOPPI database and from highly divergent cytokine families. In comparison to existing techniques, CMAPi generates more accurate alignments of interacting residues within families of interacting proteins, especially for sequences with low similarity.

It chooses approximations that are accurate enough to reproduce the essential properties of their nonlinear prototypes, yet simple enough to be analyzed completely and efficiently. It derives additional properties, such as boundedness or periodicity, by theoretical methods. I demonstrate PLR on several common nonlinear systems and on published examples from mechanical engineering.},

	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/40507},
	year = {2007},
	abstract = {Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients are physiologically fragile and require vigilant monitoring and support. The myriad of data gathered from biosensors and clinical information systems has created a challenge for clinicians to assimilate and interpret such large volumes of data. Physiologic measurements in the ICU are inherently noisy, multidimensional, and can readily fluctuate in response to therapeutic interventions as well as evolving pathophysiologic states. ICU patient monitoring systems may potentially improve the efficiency, accuracy and timeliness of clinical decision-making in intensive care. However, the aforementioned characteristics of ICU data can pose a significant signal processing and pattern recognition challenge---often leading to false and clinically irrelevant alarms. We have developed a temporal database of several thousand ICU patient records to facilitate research in advanced monitoring systems. The MIMIC-II database includes high-resolution physiologic waveforms such as ECG, blood pressures waveforms, vital sign trends, laboratory data, fluid balance, therapy profiles, and clinical progress notes over each patient's ICU stay. We quantitatively and qualitatively characterize the MIMIC-II database and include examples of clinical studies that can be supported by its unique attributes. We also introduce a novel algorithm for identifying "similar" temporal patterns that may illuminate hidden information in physiologic time series. The discovery of multi-parameter temporal patterns that are predictive of physiologic instability may aid clinicians in optimizing care. In this thesis, we introduce a novel temporal similarity metric based on a transformation of time series data into an intuitive symbolic representation.
 
The symbolic transform is based on a wavelet decomposition to characterize time series dynamics at multiple time scales. The symbolic transformation allows us to utilize classical information retrieval algorithms based on a vector-space model. Our algorithm is capable of assessing the similarity between multi-dimensional time series and is computationally efficient. We utilized our algorithm to identify similar physiologic patterns in hemodynamic time series from ICU patients. The results of this thesis demonstrate that statistical similarities between different patient time series may have meaningful physiologic interpretations in the detection of impending hemodynamic deterioration. Thus, our framework may be of potential use in clinical decision-support systems. As a generalized time series similarity metric, the algorithms that are described have applications in several other domains as well.

	abstract = {This thesis focuses on machine learning methods for extracting information from user-generated content. Instances of this data such as product and restaurant reviews have become increasingly valuable and influential in daily decision making. In this work, I consider a range of extraction tasks such as sentiment analysis and aspect-based review aggregation. These tasks have been well studied in the context of newswire documents, but the informal and colloquial nature of social media poses significant new challenges. The key idea behind our approach is to automatically induce the content structure of individual documents given a large, noisy collection of user-generated content. This structure enables us to model the connection between individual documents and effectively aggregate their content. The models I propose demonstrate that content structure can be utilized at both document and phrase level to aid in standard text analysis tasks. At the document level, I capture this idea by joining the original task features with global contextual information. The coupling of the content model and the task-specific model allows the two components to mutually influence each other during learning. At the phrase level, I utilize a generative Bayesian topic model where a set of properties and corresponding attribute tendencies are represented as hidden variables. The model explains how the observed text arises from the latent variables, thereby connecting text fragments with corresponding properties and attributes.},

The investigation centers on the interpretation of definite anaphora, that is, on the personal pronouns, and noun phrases used with a definite article the, this or that. Focussing is formalized as a process in which a speaker centers attention on a particular aspect of the discourse. An algorithmic description specifies what the speaker can focus on and how the speaker may change the focus of the discourse as the discourse unfolds. The algorithm allows for a simple focussing mechanism to be constructed: and element in focus, an ordered collection of alternate foci, and a stack of old foci. The data structure for the element in focus is a representation which encodes a limted set of associations between it and other elements from teh discourse as well as from general knowledge.

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {One of the goals of AI is to produce a computer system that can plan and act intelligently in the real world. It is difficult to do so, in part because real-world domains are very large. Existing research generally deals with the large domain size using a static representation and exploiting a single type of domain structure. This leads either to an inability to complete planning on larger domains or to poor solution quality because pertinent information is discarded. This thesis creates a framework that encapsulates existing and new abstraction and approximation methods into modules and combines arbitrary modules into a 'hierarchy that allows for dynamic representation changes. The combination of different abstraction methods allows many qualitatively different types of structure in the domain to be exploited simultaneously. The ability to change the representation dynamically allows the framework to take advantage of how different domain subparts are relevant in different ways at different times. Since the current plan tracks the current representation, choosing to simplify (or omit) distant or improbable areas of the domain sacrifices little in the way of solution quality while making the planning problem considerably easier.
 
The module hierarchy approach leads to greater abstraction that is tailored to the domain and therefore need not give up hope of creating reasonable solutions. While there are no optimality guarantees, experimental results show that suitable module choices gain computational tractability at little cost to behavioral optimality and allow the module hierarchy to solve larger and more interesting domains than previously possible.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},

	year = {2005},
	abstract = {Deploying new healthcare technologies for proactive health and elder care will become a major priority over the next decade, as medical care systems worldwide become strained by the aging populations. This thesis presents LiveNet, a distributed mobile system based on low-cost commodity hardware that can be deployed for a variety of healthcare applications. LiveNet embodies a flexible infrastructure platform intended for long-term ambulatory health monitoring with real-time data streaming and context classification capabilities. Using LiveNet, we are able to continuously monitor a wide range of physiological signals together with the user's activity and context, to develop a personalized, data-rich health profile of a user over time. Most clinical sensing technologies that exist have focused on accuracy and reliability, at the expense of cost-effectiveness, burden on the patient, and portability. Future proactive health technologies, on the other hand, must be affordable, unobtrusive, and non-invasive if the general population is going to adopt them.
 
In this thesis, we focus on the potential of using features derived from minimally invasive physiological and contextual sensors such as motion, speech, heart rate, skin conductance, and temperature/heat flux that can be used in combination with mobile technology to create powerful context-aware systems that are transparent to the user. In many cases, these non-invasive sensing technologies can completely replace more invasive diagnostic sensing for applications in long-term monitoring, behavior and physiology trending, and real-time proactive feedback and alert systems. Non-invasive sensing technologies are particularly important in ambulatory and continuous monitoring applications, where more cumbersome sensing equipment that is typically found in medical and clinical research settings is not usable. The research in this thesis demonstrates that it is possible to use simple non-invasive physiological and contextual sensing using the LiveNet system to accurately classify a variety of physiological conditions. We demonstrate that non-invasive sensing can be correlated to a variety of important physiological and behavioral phenomenon, and thus can serve as substitutes to more invasive and unwieldy forms of medical monitoring devices while still providing a high level of diagnostic power.
 
From this foundation, the LiveNet system is deployed in a number of studies to quantify physiological and contextual state. First, a number of classifiers for important health and general contextual cues such as activity state and stress level are developed from basic non-invasive physiological sensing. We then demonstrate that the LiveNet system can be used to develop systems that can classify clinically significant physiological and pathological conditions and that are robust in the presence of noise, motion artifacts, and other adverse conditions found in real-world situations. This is highlighted in a cold exposure and core body temperature study in collaboration with the U.S. Army Research Institute of Environmental Medicine. In this study, we show that it is possible to develop real-time implementations of these classifiers for proactive health monitors that can provide instantaneous feedback relevant in soldier monitoring applications. This thesis also demonstrates that the LiveNet platform can be used for long-term continuous monitoring applications to study physiological trends that vary slowly with time.
 
In a clinical study with the Psychiatry Department at the Massachusetts General Hospital, the LiveNet platform is used to continuously monitor clinically depressed patients during their stays on an in-patient ward for treatment. We show that we can accurately correlate physiology and behavior to depression state, as well as to track changes in depression state over time through the course of treatment. This study demonstrates how long-term physiology and behavioral changes can be captured to objectively measure medical treatment and medication efficacy. In another long-term monitoring study, the LiveNet platform is used to collect data on people's everyday behavior as they go through daily life. By collecting long-term behavioral data, we demonstrate the possibility of modeling and predicting high-level behavior using simple physiologic and contextual information derived solely from ambulatory mobile sensing technology.

	year = {2001},
	abstract = {Today's globally networked society places great demand on the dissemination and sharing of person specific data for many new and exciting uses. When these data are linked together, they provide an electronic shadow of a person or organization that is as identifying and personal as a fingerprint even when the information contains no explicit identifiers, such as name and phone number. Other distinctive data, such as birth date and ZIP code, often combine uniquely and can be linked to publicly available information to re-identify individuals. Producing anonymous data that remains specific enough to be useful is often a very difficult task and practice today tends to either incorrectly believe confidentiality is maintained when it is not or produces data that are practically useless. The goal of the work presented in this book is to explore computational techniques for releasing useful information in such a way that the identity of any individual or entity contained in data cannot be recognized while the data remain practically useful. I begin by demonstrating ways to learn information about entities from publicly available information. I then provide a formal framework for reasoning about disclosure control and the ability to infer the identities of entities contained within the data. I formally define and present null-map, k-map and wrong-map as models of protection. Each model provides protection by ensuring that released information maps to no, k or incorrect entities, respectively. The book ends by examining four computational systems that attempt to maintain privacy while releasing electronic information. These systems are: (1) my Scrub System, which locates personally-identifying information in letters between doctors and notes written by clinicians; (2) my Datafly II System, which generalizes and suppresses values in field-structured data sets; (3) Statistics Netherlands' pt-Argus System, which is becoming a European standard for producing public-use data; and, (4) my k-Similar algorithm, which finds optimal solutions such that data are minimally distorted while still providing adequate protection. By introducing anonymity and quality metrics, I show that Datafly II can overprotect data, Scrub and p-Argus can fail to provide adequate protection, but k-similar finds optimal results.},

	year = {2016},
	abstract = {The revolution of ``Big Data'' has reached various fields like marketing, healthcare, and criminology, where domain experts wish to find and understand interesting patterns from data. This thesis studies patterns that are defined by subsets of observations or subsets of features. The first part of the thesis studies patterns defined by subsets of observations. We look at a specific type of pattern, crime series (a set of crimes committed by the same individual or group) and develop two pattern detection algorithms. The first method is a sequential pattern building algorithm called Series Finder, which resembles how crime analysts process information instinctively and grows a crime series starting from a couple of seed crimes. The second method is a subspace clustering with cluster-specific feature selection, which is supervised when learning similarity graphs in order to reduce computation. Both methods we propose achieved promising results on a decade's worth of crime pattern data collected by the Crime Analysis Unit of the Cambridge Police Department. The second part of the thesis studies patterns defined by subsets of features. We develop methods and theory for building Rule Set models with the hallmark of interpretability. Interpretability is inherent in using association rules to explain predicted results. We first design two methods for building rule sets for binary classification. The first method Bayesian Rule Set (BRS) uses a Bayesian framework with priors that favor small models. The Bayesian priors also bring significant computational benefits to MAP inferences by reducing the search space and restraining the sampling chain within appropriate regions. We apply BRS models to an in-vehicle recommender system data set we collected via Amazon Mechanical Turk to study the customers and contexts that would encourage acceptance of coupons. We develop another model Optimized Rule Set (ORS) using optimization methods to directly construct rule sets from data, without pre-mining rules or discretizing continuous attributes. As a main application of ORS, we build a diagnostic screening tool for obstructive sleep apnea trained on data provided by the Sleep Lab at Mass General Hospital. Our models achieve high accuracy with a substantial gain in interpretability over other methods. Lastly, we build a Causal Rule Set (CRS) model for causal analysis, to identify subgroups that can benefit from a treatment. CRS combines BRS and Bayesian Logistic Regression. We take advantage of different strategies in inference algorithm to speed up computation. Simulations and experiments show that distributing treatment according to CRS models enhances average treatment effect.},

	abstract = {Privacy laws are an important facet of our society. But they can also serve as formidable barriers to medical research. The same laws that prevent casual disclosure of medical data have also made it difficult for researchers to access the information they need to conduct research into the causes of disease. But it is possible to overcome some of these legal barriers through technology. The US law known as HIPAA, for example, allows medical records to be released to researchers without patient consent if the records are provably anonymized prior to their disclosure. It is not enough for records to be seemingly anonymous. For example, one researcher estimates that 87.1\% of the US population can be uniquely identified by the combination of their zip, gender, and date of birth - fields that most people would consider anonymous. One promising technique for provably anonymizing records is called k-anonymity. It modifies each record so that it matches k other individuals in a population - where k is an arbitrary parameter. This is achieved by, for example, changing specific information such as a date of birth, to a less specific counterpart such as a year of birth.
 
Previous studies have shown that achieving k-anonymity while minimizing information loss is an NP-hard problem; thus a brute force search is out of the question for most real world data sets. In this thesis, we present an open source Java toolkit that seeks to anonymize data while minimizing information loss. It uses an optimization framework and methods typically used to attack NP-hard problems including greedy search and clustering strategies. To test the toolkit a number of previously unpublished algorithms and information loss metrics have been implemented. These algorithms and measures are then empirically evaluated using a data set consisting of 1000 real patient medical records taken from a local hospital. The theoretical contributions of this work include: (1) A new threat model for privacy - that allows an adversary's capabilities to be modeled using a formalism called a virtual attack database. (2) Rationally defensible information loss measures - we show that previously published information loss measures are difficult to defend because they fall prey to what is known as the "weighted indexing problem." To remedy this problem we propose a number of information-loss measures that are in principle more attractive than previously published measures.
 
Shown that suppression and generalization - two concepts that were previously thought to be distinct - are in fact the same thing; insofar as each generalization can be represented by a suppression and vice versa. (4) We show that Domain Generalization Hierarchies can be harvested to assist the construction of a Bayesian network to measure information loss. (5) A database can be thought of as a sub-sample of a population. We outline a technique that allows one to predict k-anonymity in a population. This allows us, under some conditions, to release records that match fewer than k individuals in a database while still achieving k-anonymity against an adversary according to some probability and confidence interval. While we have chosen to focus our thesis on the anonymization of medical records, our methodologies, toolkit and command line tools are equally applicable to any tabular data such as the data one finds in relational databases - the most common type of database today.},

	abstract = {Fluid bolus therapy (FBT) is a treatment commonly administered to treat seriously ill hypotensive patients in intensive care units ({ICU}s). Unfortunately, only a fraction of hypotensive patients respond positively to FBT, and emergency room physicians are constantly challenged in determining whether administering FBT will result in a corresponding increase in blood pressure. In this thesis, we utilized regression models and attention-based recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms to predict the response of hypotensive patients to FBT from a multi-clinical information system large-scale database. We investigated time-series modeling with the use of the stacked long short term memory network (LSTM) and the gated recurrent units network (GRU) models by altering the representation of our data and time-aggregated modeling using logistic regression algorithms with regularization on our original representation. Additionally, we applied the attention mechanism for clinical interpretability on our RNN models applied on the time-series representation. Among all the modeling strategies and data representations, the stacked LSTM with the attention mechanism predicted the success or failure of the FBT on hypotensive patients with a highest accuracy of 0.852 and area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.925. The aim of the study is to help identify hypotensive patients in ICUs who will experience a sufficient increase in blood pressure after FBT administration. The end goal of these results would be to develop a clinically actionable decision support tool for intensive care management.},

	abstract = {Severity of illness scores are commonly used in critical care medicine to guide treatment decisions and benchmark the quality of medical care. These scores operate in part by predicting patient mortality in the ICU using physiological variables including lab values, vital signs, and admission information. However, existing evidence suggests that current mortality predictors are less performant on patients who have an especially high risk of mortality in the ICU. This thesis seeks to reconcile this difference by developing a custom high risk mortality predictor for high risk patients in a process termed sequential modeling. Starting with a base set of features derived from the APACHE IV score, this thesis details the engineering of more complex features tailored to the high risk prediction task and development of a logistic regression model trained on the Philips eICU-CRD dataset. This high risk model is shown to be more performant than a baseline severity of illness score, APACHE IV, on the high risk subpopulation. Moreover, a combination of the baseline severity of illness score and the high risk model is shown to be better calibrated and more performant on patients of all risk types. Lastly, I show that this secondary customization approach has useful applications not only in the general population, but in specific patient subpopulations as well. This thesis thus offers a new perspective and strategy for mortality prediction in the ICU, and when taken in context with the increasing digitization of patient medical records, offers a more personalized predictive model in the ICU.},

	abstract = {Real-time prediction of clinical interventions remains a challenge within intensive care units (ICUs). This task is complicated by data sources that are noisy, sparse, heterogeneous and outcomes that are imbalanced. In this thesis, we integrate data from all available ICU sources (vitals, labs, notes, demographics) and focus on learning rich representations of this data to predict onset and weaning of multiple invasive interventions. We first investigate the ability of both deep and sequence autoencoders to effectively learn low-dimensional and dense underlying patient states in an unsupervised way. In addition, we compare these representations along with both long short-term memory networks (LSTM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) for prediction of five intervention tasks: invasive ventilation, non-invasive ventilation, vasopressors, colloid boluses, and crystalloid boluses. Our predictions are done in a forward-facing manner to enable "real-time" performance, and predictions are made with a six hour gap time to support clinically actionable planning. We achieve state-of- the-art results on our predictive tasks using deep architectures. We explore the use of feature occlusion to interpret LSTM models, and compare this to the inter-pretability gained from examining inputs that maximally activate CNN outputs. We show that our models are able to significantly outperform baselines in intervention prediction, as well as provide insight into model learning, which is crucial for the adoption of such models in practice.},

	abstract = {Pulmonary diseases are responsible for more than 15\% of deaths worldwide. Much of this burden is concentrated in the developing world, where these diseases cause 19\% of deaths. In much of the developing world, pulmonary diseases are under-diagnosed and misdiagnosed because the correct equipment is not available or health care is provided by workers with insufficient training. To help improve the diagnosis of pulmonary disease, we built a pulmonary diagnostic kit that consists of an electronic stethoscope, an augmented reality peak flow meter, and an electronic questionnaire. Using this kit, we collected data from patients who visited the Chest Research Foundation, a pulmonary clinic in Pune, India. Using the data collected from these patients, we pursued several of avenues of research. First, we trained algorithms to automatically detect two adventitious breath sounds: wheezes and crackles. We used two approaches to detect these sounds: traditional signal processing methods and new techniques from deep semi-supervised learning. Both techniques showed moderate success at identifying wheezes and crackles. Second, we evaluated the diagnostic potential of detecting wheezes and crackles and compared it to using signal processing analysis of lung sounds to directly detect pulmonary disease. We showed that this new technique leads to improved diagnostic accuracy. This finding indicates that future research should focus less on lung sound identification. Third, we combined measurements from all three components of our kit to predict the diagnosis of patients with pulmonary disease. We showed that most of the diagnostic accuracy of the kit was provided by the peak flow meter and questionnaire combination. Together, these two devices were able to accurately detect patients with asthma and COPD. After developing the diagnostic algorithms, we built an Android application to guide a user through the necessary data collection to arrive at a diagnosis. The application was designed to create questionnaires and data queries from an externally defined model definition file, allowing the application to be easily repurposed for different classification tasks in medicine and other fields. Future research will expand the use of the pulmonary diagnostic kit to include additional pulmonary diseases and will test its use in a large-scale field study to determine its accuracy as a screening tool for asthma and COPD. If the results of future trials are consistent with the findings in this thesis, the kit and algorithm combination may provide useful information for improving diagnosis of pulmonary disease.},

	abstract = {Data-driven analysis can improve our understanding of medicine, and data from electronic health records and labs has been used successfully in predictive tasks. Less advanced analysis has been done on health insurance claims data, which can be rich and more structured but large in scale. Taiwan has had nationalized health insurance for twenty years; its National Health Research Institute Database (NHIRD) contains records of insurance claims, including medications, prescriptions, and treatment costs for both inpatient and outpatient visits, spanning sixteen years and a million patients. The NHIRD enables longitudinal studies of a patient's medical progression as well as aggregation and generalization to population-level insights. We conducted preliminary exploration of data trends in aggregate, such as diagnosis code frequency and average treatment cost over time. An infrastructure to perform large-scale queries and handle results was required to effectively use the NHIRD for research applications. After indexing database tables to improve query performance, we created a pipeline in Python to connect to and query the database, analyze data for hypothesis discovery and hypothesis testing, convert Taiwanese codes to international standards, and produce plots and graphs. This pipeline was used to examine drug side effects and comorbidities observed across a population, accounting for demographic variables. We also studied patient-specific longitudinal matrices of medical events, which were highly sparse. We attempted quantitative imputation methods to densify these matrices, but because the data was binary (indicating the presence of an event at a given time), categorical, and irregular, advanced imputation offered limited benefit. Nevertheless, we discovered interesting patterns in cohorts of diabetes patients treated with various classes of drugs. This information can be exploited in computational phenotyping and other learning methods, and combined with other data sources it could increase accuracy of clinical predictive tasks.},

In this thesis, we developed probabilistic models for modeling variable kinetics and temporal dynamics of states. We applied the models to the prediction of acute kidney injury (AKI), but the models are applicable to other medical conditions as well. It is known that serum creatinine follows first-order clearance kinetics. We developed a stochastic kinetic model for first-order clearance and used it to model creatinine kinetics. Some properties implied by the model that are verifiable with the available data are consistent with the empirical results. Those properties are mean-reversion, variation with linear standard deviation, and convergence of variance to a finite value. Based on the stochastic kinetic model, creatinine can be treated as a lognormal random variable with state-dependent parameters. We model the temporal dynamics of kidney states and creatinine using a Hidden Markov Model. Observations of creatinine are assumed to be random variables, with baseline creatinine as mean. Each individual baseline is itself a random variable sampled from a population distribution. Baseline for each patient can be estimated by combining the population distribution and all creatinine observations of the patient using techniques similar to Bayesian inference. Prediction of acute kidney injury with this generative model gives an AUC of 0.8259 and 0.8497 for female and male population respectively.},

	year = {2013},
	abstract = {Introduction. Predictive models derived from electronic health records in the intensive care unit (ICU) have traditionally used data from the first 24 hours of admission, or up to 48-72 hours. While these may have high accuracy and have fewer limitations due to missing data, they are not useful for decision-making during the early hours of an admission. Infections are common in the ICU and international guidelines recommend that antibiotics be administered as soon as possible. Established goals for early administration of antibiotics range from 1-6 hours. Using structured admission data, we attempt to develop a predictive model to provide early identification of patients who warrant antibiotic administration, from a cohort of patients who were not identified by clinicians as having an infection. Methods. The Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) is a database of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ICU between 2001 and 2008. Using the MIMIC- II database and a combination of natural language processing and inpatient orders, we identified patients who did not receive antibiotics within 6 hours of admission. Sociodemographic, clinical, and process variables were extracted for each patient. The dataset was divided into a training and test set with an 80:20 split. Logistic regression models were built. Results. 9478 patients met inclusion criteria. Of these, 1403 (14.8\%) did not receive antibiotics during the first 6 hours but were subsequently started on antibiotics within two days of hospital admission. The most common antibiotics started were vancomycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole. A forward-selection logistic regression on the training set, based on a candidate list of variables comprised from theory and bivariate testing, was significant with a c-statistic of 0.67. A logistic regression model on the test set had a c-statistic of 0.65. Most of the variables could not be tested due to data not missing completely at random. The only variables that were significant were physicians' ordering of lactic acid and liver function tests (LFTs). Conclusion. It is possible to build a significant logistic regression model based on admission data. The importance of ordering behavior, a proxy for clinician decision-making, indicates that all relevant data is not captured in structured fields.},

We present a medical concept and relation extraction system (medNERR) that incorporates hand-built rules and constrained conditional models. We focus on two concept types (i.e., medications and medical conditions) and the pairwise administered-for relation between these two concepts. For medication extraction, we design a rule-based baseline medNERRgreedy med that identifies medications using the UMLS dictionary. We enhance medNERRgreedy med with information from topic models and additional corpus-derived heuristics, and show that the final medication extraction system outperforms the baseline and improves on state-of-the-art systems. For medical conditions extraction we design a Hidden Markov Model with conditional constraints. The conditional constraints frame world knowledge into a probabilistic model and help support model decisions. We approach relation extraction as a sequence labeling task, where we label the context between the medications and the medical concepts that are involved in an administered-for relation. We use a Hidden Markov Model with conditional constraints for labeling the relation context. We show that the relation extraction system outperforms current state of the art systems and that its main advantage comes from the incorporation of domain knowledge through conditional constraints. We compare our sequence labeling approach for relation extraction to a classification approach and show that our approach improves final system performance.},

	abstract = {Accurate and comprehensive data form the lifeblood of health care. Unfortunately, there is much evidence that current data collection methods sometimes fail. Our hypothesis is that it should be possible to improve the thoroughness and quality of information gathered through clinical encounters by developing a computer system that (a) listens to a conversation between a patient and a provider, (b) uses automatic speech recognition technology to transcribe that conversation to text, (c) applies natural language processing methods to extract the important clinical facts from the conversation, (d) presents this information in real time to the participants, permitting correction of errors in understanding, and (e) organizes those facts into an encounter note that could serve as a first draft of the note produces by the clinician. In this thesis, we present our attempts to measure the performances of two state-of-the-art automatic speech recognizers (ASRs) for the task of transcribing clinical conversations, and explore the potential ways of optimizing these software packages for the specific task. In the course of this thesis, we have (1) introduced a new method for quantitatively measuring the difference between two language models and showed that conversational and dictational speech have different underlying language models, (2) measured the perplexity of clinical conversations and dictations and shown that spontaneous speech has a higher perplexity than dictational speech, (3) improved speech recognition accuracy by language adaptation using a conversational corpus, and (4) introduced a fast and simple algorithm for cross talk elimination in two speaker settings.},

	abstract = {Extensive bedside monitoring in hospital Intensive Care Units (ICU) has resulted in a deluge of information on patient physiology. Consequently, clinical decision makers have to reason with data that is simultaneously large and high-dimensional. Mechanisms to compress these datasets while retaining their salient features are in great need. Previous work in this area has focused exclusively on supervised models to predict specific hazardous outcomes like mortality. These models, while effective, are highly specific and do not generalize easily to other outcomes. This research describes the use of non-parametric unsupervised learning to discover abstract patient states that summarize a patient's physiology. The resulting model focuses on grouping physiologically similar patients instead of predicting particular outcomes. This type of cluster analysis has traditionally been done in small, low-dimensional, error-free datasets. Since our real-world clinical dataset affords none of these luxuries, we describe the engineering required to perform the analysis on a large, high-dimensional, sparse, noisy and mixed dataset. The discovered groups showed cohesiveness, isolation and correspondence to natural groupings. These groups were also tested for enrichment towards survival, Glasgow Coma Scale values and critical heart rate events. In each case, we found groups which were enriched and depleted towards those outcomes.},

We automate the extraction of relevant parts of medical history files; if sufficiently accurate, this would eliminate the need for human evaluators to comb through hundreds of pages of medical history files. We first create a list of medical concepts, mainly disease and procedure names, from the cardiovascular section of the "Blue Book" for Disability Evaluation under Social Security. Then, using a variation of the longest common substring algorithm, we characterize each medical file line using its substring overlaps with the list of medical concepts. Finally, with human annotations of whether each medical file line is relevant or not, we build machine learning classifiers predicting each line's relevance using its overlap characterization. The classifiers we use are Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machines.},

	abstract = {We address the problem of weakly-supervised relation extraction in hospital discharge summaries. Sentences with pre-identified concept types (for example: medication, test, problem, symptom) are labeled with the relationship between the concepts. We present a novel technique for weakly-supervised bootstrapping of a classifier for this task: Groundtruth Budgeting. In the case of highly-overlapping, self-similar datasets as is the case with the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge corpus, the performance of classifiers on the minority classes is often poor. To address this we set aside a random portion of the groundtruth at the beginning of bootstrapping which will be gradually added as the classifier is bootstrapped. The classifier chooses groundtruth samples to be added by measuring the confidence of its predictions on them and choosing samples for which it has the least confident predictions. By adding samples in this fashion, the classifier is able to increase its coverage of the decision space while not adding too many majority-class examples. We evaluate this approach on the 2010 i2b2/VA challenge corpus containing of 477 patient discharge summaries and show that with a training corpus of 349 discharge summaries, budgeting 10\% of the corpus achieves equivalent results to a bootstrapping classifier starting with the entire corpus. We compare our results to those of other papers published in the proceedings of the 2010 Fourth i2b2/VA Shared-Task and Workshop.},

	type = {Master's Thesis},

	year = {2010},
	abstract = {The promise of the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) to store, retrieve, and communicate medical information effectively for a caregiver team has remained largely unfulfilled since its advent in the late 1960's. Previous studies have cited that the communication function of the EMR is critical to its successful adoption. Based on Mediated Agent Interaction theory, this study proposes a message-based model of transmission of clinical information in the EMR. This model is implemented on an existing ICU clinical database, MIMIC II, to produce a database of transmission events. Three metrics for information transmission are derived from exploratory and object-attribute analyses: transmission volume, duration, and load (or rate). Also derived is a set of features that includes a patient's clinical conditions (with acuity scores and mortality), caregiver type and distribution, care-unit locations, duration of care, and types of clinical records. This list of features is reduced to a set of explanatory variables using correlation and univariate logistic regression. Bayesian Network (BN) models are constructed to predict levels of the transmission metrics. BN models show high prediction accuracy for measuring various levels of messaging volume and load, but marginal accuracy for messaging duration. Results from these methods suggest that the volume of information transmitted in the ICU for adult patients is primarily through charts entered by nurses and respiratory technicians (RTs). The amount of data recorded by RTs increases for patients with higher acuity scores, but transmission from nurses decreases for these patients. The rate at which information is transmitted in the ICU for adult patients is directly related to the rate at which notes and charts are entered, as well as the care-unit location where the data is recorded. Further study is required to investigate factors influencing the length of time information is transmitted in the ICU. This study's findings are based on data recorded by caregivers as clinical observations. Further study is necessary to corroborate these results with clinical communications data, including evidence of reception of clinical information by caregivers. The model proposed by this study may be used as a basis for future research and to discover other patterns of clinical communications.},

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Introduction. Models for mortality prediction are traditionally developed from prospective multi-center observational studies involving a heterogeneous group of patients to optimize external validity. We hypothesize that local customized modeling using retrospective data from a homogeneous subset of patients will provide a more accurate prediction than this standard approach. We tested this hypothesis on patients admitted to the ICU with acute kidney injury (AKI), and evaluated variables from the first 72 hours of admission. Methods. The Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) is a database of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ICU. Using the MIMIC II database, we identified patients who developed acute kidney injury and who survived at least 72 hours in the ICU. 118 variables were extracted from each patient. Second and third level customization of the Simplified Organ Failure Score (SAPS) was performed using logistic regression analysis and the best fitted models were compared in terms of Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow Goodness-of-Fit test (HL). The patient cohort was divided into a training and test data with a 70:30 split. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed on the training set for every combination of variables that were evaluated. The best fitted model from the cross-validation was then evaluated using the test set, and the AUC and the HL p value on the test set were reported. Results. A total of 1400 patients were included in the study. Of these, 970 survived and 430 died in the hospital (30.7\% mortality). We observed progressive improvement in the performance of SAPS on this subset of patients (AUC=0.6419, HL p=0) with second level (AUC=0.6639, HL p=0.2056), and third level (AUC=0.7419, HL p=0.6738) customization. The best fitted model incorporated variables from the first 3 days of ICU admission. The variables that were most predictive of hospital mortality in the multivariate analysis are the maximum blood urea nitrogen and the minimum systolic blood pressure from the third day. Conclusion. A logistic regression model built using local data for patients with AKI performed better than SAPS, the current standard mortality prediction scoring system.

	year = {2009},
	abstract = {Telephone linked care (TLC) is a telehealth intervention that has been shown to be effective in a variety of clinical settings. TLC is an interactive computerized telephone system. The system 'speaks' to patients, asking them questions and understanding their responses. There is logic built into the calls, so that a patient's response to a question will dictate the next question that is asked. This serves to personalize the call for each patient, and makes the conversation more realistic. All of the patients' responses are stored in a database. This database provides much opportunity for analysis because a single phone call contains many responses. Visualization is an important way of gaining insight into data. Visualization can make data easier to understand and process. Different aspects of data can be encoded in a visualization. The TLC data lends itself to visualization. By viewing each of the questions that the system asks as nodes, and connecting the nodes by the chronological order in which these questions are asked, a tree structure will reveal the conversational paths that are taken in the calls. By combining data from multiple calls and encoding them in this tree structure, new insights can be gained into the TLC data. For example, the frequency with which questions are answered in a particular way can be encoded to reveal the most common pathways through the tree. This paper describes a visualization application of TLC data which will allow researchers to gain new insights into the TLC conversations and into medical interviews in general.},

Coreference resolution enables us to find changes in the state of entities and makes it possible to answer questions regarding the information thus obtained.

A system that could enable plug-and-play connectivity and interoperability for medical devices would improve patient safety, save hospitals time and money, and provide data for electronic medical records. However, existing medical device connectivity standards, such as IEEE 11073, have not been widely adopted by medical device manufacturers. This lack of adoption is likely due to the complexity of the existing standards and their poor support for legacy devices. We attempted to design a simpler, more flexible standard for an integrated clinical environment manager. Our standard, called the ICEMAN standard, provides a meta-model for describing medical devices and a communication protocol to enable plug-and-play connectivity for compliant devices. To demonstrate the capabilities of ICEMAN standard, we implemented a service-oriented system that can pair application requirements with device capabilities, based on the ICEMAN device meta-model. This system enables medical devices to interoperate with the manager in a driverless fashion. The system was tested using simulated medical devices.},

	year = {2006},
	abstract = {Using artificial intelligence to assist physicians in patient care has received sustained interest over the past several decades. Recently, with automated systems at most bedsides, the amount of patient information collected continues to increase, providing specific impetus for intelligent systems that can interpret this information. In fact, the large set of sensors and test results, often measured repeatedly over long periods of time, make it challenging for caregivers to quickly utilize all of the data for optimal patient treatment. This research focuses on predicting the survival of ICU patients throughout their stay. Unlike traditional static mortality models, this survival prediction is explored as an indicator of patient state and trajectory. Using survival analysis techniques and machine learning, models are constructed that predict individual patient survival probabilities at fixed intervals in the future. These models seek to help physicians interpret the large amount of data available in order to provide optimal patient care. We find that the survival predictions from our models are comparable to survival predictions using the SAPS score, but are available throughout the patient's ICU course instead of only at 24 hours after admission. Additionally, we demonstrate effective prediction of patient mortality over fixed windows in the future.},

For disease and symptoms, we determine whether the problem is present, absent, uncertain, or associated with somebody else (assertion classification). Finally, we classify the semantic relationships existing between our categories (semantic relationship classification). Our approach utilizes a series of statistical models that rely heavily on local lexical and syntactic context, and achieve competitive results compared to more complex NLP solutions. We conclude the thesis by presenting the design for the Category and Relationship Extractor (CaRE). CaRE combines our solutions to de-identification, semantic category recognition, assertion classification, and semantic relationship classification into a single application that facilitates the easy extraction of semantic information from medical text.},

Important pathophysiologic events in the patient data streams must be recognized and annotated by expert clinicians in order to create a ``gold standard'' database for training and evaluating automated monitoring systems. Annotating the database requires, among other things, analyzing and extracting important clinical information from textual patient data such as nursing admission and progress notes, and using the data to define and document important clinical events during the patient's ICU stay. Two major text-related annotation issues are addressed in this research. First, the documented clinical events must be described in a standardized vocabulary suitable for machine analysis. Second, an advanced monitoring system would need an automated way to extract meaning from the nursing notes, as part of its decision-making process. The thesis presents and evaluates methods to code significant clinical events into standardized terminology and to automatically extract significant information from free-text medical notes.},

Described is an automated tool that creates artificial patient clusters by varying a large variety of realistic outbreak parameters. The cluster creation tool is an open-source program that accepts a set of outbreak parameters and creates artificial geospatial patient data for a single cluster or a series of similar clusters. This helps automate the process of rigorous testing and validation of outbreak detection algorithms. Using the cluster generator, single patient clusters and series of patient clusters were created - as files and series of files containing patient longitude and latitude coordinates. These clusters were then tested and validated using a publicly-available GIS visualization program. All generated clusters were properly created within the ranges that were entered as parameters at program execution. Sample semi-synthetic datasets from the cluster creation tool were then used to validate a popular spatial outbreak detection algorithm, the M-Statistic.},

This thesis uses similar models to construct a monitoring system that is able to run in real time, based on a continuous, linearly segmented process data input stream. The instantiation of temporally significant template points against the process data is determined through a simulated annealing algorithm. The rankings of competing hypotheses in the monitor set is based on the distance of these template points from their expected temporal values, along with the area between the process data measurements and the value constraints placed on those parameters. The feasibility of the real-time monitor was evaluated in the domain of pediatric growth, particularly in comparison to previous versions of TrenDx, using an expert gold standard of the diagnoses of pediatric endocrinologists. Real-time TrenDx shows promise in its monitoring abilities and should be evaluated in other domains which are more suited to its continuous data stream input model.},

It discusses the requirements for effective home- based monitoring and considers different architectural approaches to providing auto- mated acquisition and storage of patient physiological readings as well as gathering qualitative data through patient interaction. Heart-At-Home, built for Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) patients, is a prototype implementation that partially meets these requirements. When a patient stands on the scale, the system automatically reads the weight, gathers relevant contextual data by prompting the user through a touch-screen visual interface, and stores all readings in the patient's lifelong medical record.},

In addition, recent advances in graph based search techniques derived from Kleinberg's work [22, 23] has been impressive. This thesis looks at these two aspects from a single perspective. First, we analyze variants of the graph based search algorithm that adapt to user preference [7] and extend them. Second, we develop a persistent user profiling technique, utilizing a web ontology provided by the Open Directory Project. In achieving these goals, we implement a real-time personalized search engine and run sets of controlled experiments to analyze the performance of our system.},

	year = {2001},
	abstract = {In an online community of any size, every user garners reputations for different contexts through interactions with other users. When any user in the online community is interested in a certain context, the user would value the opinions of those users of high repute with respect to that context. However, if the online community is of any significant size, a user might not know every other user in the community. Therefore, a reputation brokering mechanism needs to be incorporated so that an interested user would be able to trace paths through other users to the reputable users. From social network theories, there exist centrality measures that can be used to determine the reputation of users in a network based on the number of in-degrees and out-degrees. However, different users in the network can have varying tastes and opinions with respect to a given context. Since centrality measures determine the reputation of users based on aggregate opinion, a user who has different tastes from the majority of the other users might not agree with the reputable users selected by the centrality measures. This justifies the need for developing personalized rating systems that are able to personalize for any user a selection of other users that he would regard as highly reputable. In this thesis, two such rating systems are developed and compared against the existing centrality measures. When tested over various dimensions such as network size and network connectivity, there is evidence that the personalized rating systems perform better than the traditional measures of reputation in the selection of reputable individuals.},

	year = {2003},
	abstract = {The lack of effective data integration and knowledge representation in patient monitoring limits its utility to clinicians. Intelligent alarm algorithms that use artificial intelligence techniques have the potential to reduce false alarm rates and to improve data integration and knowledge representation. Crucial to the development of such algorithms is a well-annotated data set. In previous studies, clinical events were either unavailable or annotated without accurate time synchronization with physiological signals, generating uncertainties during both the development and evaluation of intelligent alarm algorithms.

This research aims to help eliminate these uncertainties by designing a system that simultaneously collects physiological data and clinical annotations at the bedside, and to develop alarm algorithms in real time based on patient-specific data collected while using this system.
In a standard pediatric intensive care unit, a working prototype of this system has helped collect a dataset of 196 hours of vital sign measurements at 1 Hz with 325 alarms generated by the bedside monitor and 2 instances of false negatives. About 89\% of these alarms were clinically relevant true positives; 6\% were true positives without clinical relevance; and 5\% were false positives. Real-time machine learning showed improved performance over time and generated alarm algorithms that outperformed the previous generation of bedside monitors and came close in performance to the new generation.

Results from this research suggest that the alarm algorithm(s) of the new patient monitoring systems have significantly improved sensitivity and specificity. They also demonstrated the feasibility of real-time learning at the bedside. Overall, they indicate that the methods developed in this research have the potential of helping provide patient-specific decision support for critical care.},

GenInfer+ is based upon an earlier genetic risk program created by Peter Szolovits named GenInferII which used a Bayesian network to calculate risks to individuals for simple inheritable diseases.

This thesis had two goals. The first goal was to design a useful tool for genetic counselors in genetic risk analysis. This entailed not only creating an easy to use system, but also designing an extensible system which would easily support the addition of future functionality needed by genetic counselors. Particular attention was paid to how genetic diseases can be modeled using a standard Bayesian network.

The second goal of this thesis was to create a system which would serve as a test bed for research into Bayesian networks and their application to practical problems. The system was designed using independent modules which communicate through a standard interface. New implementations of Bayesian networks and inheritable diseases can be inserted without disrupting the whole system.},

	type = {PhD Thesis},
	url = {https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/118090},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of digitized clinical data creates new opportunities to use machine learning to unlock clinical insights, and ultimately improve healthcare delivery. However, while data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have become common, they present unique challenges. Clinical data are noisy, sparse, irregularly sampled, and often biased in their recording of health state and care patterns. Further, much of the most important information used by care staff is recorded in unstructured text notes that are not easily deciphered by non-experts.

In this work, we present machine learning methods that distill large amounts of text-based clinical data into latent representations. These representations are then used to predict a variety of important outcomes. In particular, we focus on prediction tasks that can provide evidence-based risk assessment and forecasting in settings with guidelines that have not traditionally been data-driven. We consider several abstractions for clinical narrative text, and evaluate their utility on common predictive tasks, such as mortality and readmission. We argue that a "good" representation will improve performance on these tasks and that multiple representations may be necessary, as different models excel on differing tasks.

We present three case studies in which we use representations of clinical text to improve performance of clinical prediction tasks. First, we augment predictive models that used baseline clinical features by including features from clinical progress notes [31].These features are derived using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and incorporated as features using per- patient topic membership. Notably, this representation has the benefit of interpretable topics over which each patient can be represented as a distribution.

Second, we explore the expressive power of clinical prose by evaluating the performance of several common models on both downstream clinical tasks and their ability to identify information contained in patients' notes [7]. This stands in contrast to much prior work that positions the utility of a given model solely with respect to its ability to improve downstream clinical performance. Such extrinsic evaluations are blind to much of the insight contained in the notes, thus motivating the need for intrinsic evaluations.

Finally, we use the text-based metadata associated with EHR encodings to allow the transfer of predictive models from one database to another [35]. Existing machine learning methods typically assume consistency in how semantically equivalent information is encoded. However, the way information is recorded differs across institutions and over time, often rendering potentially useful data obsolescent. To address this problem, we map database- specific representations of the information to a shared set of semantic concepts, thus allowing models to be built from or transition across different databases.},

	abstract = {Many recent studies of trust and reputation are made in the context of commercial reputation or rating systems for online communities. Most of these systems have been constructed without a formal rating model or much regard for our sociological understanding of these concepts. We first provide a critical overview of the state of research on trust and reputation. We then propose a formal quantitative model for the rating process. Based on this model, we formulate two personalized rating schemes and demonstrate their effectiveness at inferring trust experimentally using a simulated dataset and a real world movie-rating dataset. Our experiments show that the popular global rating scheme widely used in commercial electronic communities is inferior to our personalized rating schemes when sufficient ratings among members are available. The level of sufficiency is then discussed. In comparison with other models of reputation, we quantitatively show that our framework provides significantly better estimations of reputation. "Better" is discussed with respect to a rating process and specific games as defined in this work. Secondly, we propose a mathematical framework for modeling trust and reputation that is rooted in findings from the social sciences. In particular, our framework makes explicit the importance of social information (i.e., indirect channels of inference) in aiding members of a social network choose whom they want to partner with or to avoid. Rating systems that make use of such indirect channels of inference are necessarily personalized in nature, catering to the individual context of the rater. Finally, we have extended our trust and reputation framework toward addressing a fundamental problem for social science and biology: evolution of cooperation.
 
We show that by providing an indirect inference mechanism for the propagation of trust and reputation, cooperation among selfish agents can be explained for a set of game theoretic simulations. For these simulations in particular, our proposal is shown to have provided more cooperative agent communities than existing schemes are able to.},

	year = {2001},
	abstract = {The difficulty of exchanging information between heterogeneous medical databases remains one of the chief obstacles in achieving a unified patient medical record. Although methods have been developed to address differences in data formats, system software, and communication protocols, automated data exchange between disparate systems still remains an elusive goal. The Medical Information Acquisition and Transmission Enabler (MEDIATE) system identifies semantically equivalent concepts between databases to facilitate information exchange. MEDIATE employs a semantic network representation to model underlying native databases and to serve as an interface for database queries. This representation generates a semantic context for data concepts that can subsequently be exploited to perform automated concept matching between disparate databases. To test the feasibility of this system, medical laboratory databases from two different institutions were represented within MEDIATE and automated concept matching was performed. The experimental results show that concepts that existed in both laboratory databases were always correctly recognized as candidate matches.
 
In addition, concepts which existed in only one database could often be matched with more "generalized" concepts in the other database that could still provide useful information. The architecture of MEDIATE offers advantages in system scalability and robustness. Since concept matching is performed automatically, the only work required to enable data exchange is construction of the semantic network representation. No pre-negotiation is required between institutions to identify data that is compatible for exchange, and there is no additional overhead to add more databases to the exchange network. Because the concept matching occurs dynamically at the time of information exchange, the system is robust to modifications in the underlying native databases as long as the semantic network representations are appropriately updated.

	year = {1998},
	abstract = {The feasibility of using the terminology of the individual patient to capture and express the individual's particular, perhaps unique, value system for healthiness is explored as a means to evaluate the quality of life. The hypothesis is that a systematic approach that treats the patient as a competent expert on a patient's perception of what it means to be healthy is a viable approach to his or her values. It is anticipated that eliciting such knowledge in a form that health care providers can use will enhance medical decision making. A systematic and rigorous protocol is described consisting of a reconstruction of utility assessment using traditional methodological building blocks applied to the descriptors elicited from the individual.

The representation of values is multidimensional. Ordered nominal scales are constructed from the words of the individual's description of familiar people in a structured interview. A complete list of comprehensive scales is composed as indicated by the responses of the individual to hypothetical decisions involving tradeoffs. The result is a scoring system for health state descriptions suitable to represent values for the outcomes in medical decision models constructed by the medical community. The output is a patient preference model referred to as an Individualized Multidimensional Quality of Life (IMQOL) model. This model also provides a means to describe and rank potential outcomes from the same individualized perspective.

Feasibility is explored by empirical evaluation of sixteen interviews of dialysis patients with the IMQOL protocol and applying the resulting model to the patient's own health as well as four other states of health common in dialysis therapy. Comparison is made to results of quality of life assessment with standard gamble and time tradeoff methods in the same patients for the same described outcomes.
Qualitative responses from patients regarding their confidence in the representation of their values are rewarding. Results are quantitatively comparable to traditional utility assessment. A prototypic computer program is used to substantiate the programmability and potential for automation. The protocol expands the information contributing to understanding by both the health care provider and the patient. Future evaluation and extension are discussed.},

	year = {1994},
	abstract = {This thesis presents a knowledge-based approach to diagnostic process monitoring. The cornerstone of this work is the representation and detection of multivariate trends in process data. The trend representation, called a trend template, denotes a time-varying pat- tern in multiple variables common to a diagnostic population. Each pattern contains repre- sentations for landmark events and a set of phases, each temporally uncertain. The phases are represented by a partially ordered set of temporal intervals. Bound to each interval are constraints on real-valued functions of measurable parameters. The constraints are low- order polynomial regression models, with either qualitative or quantitative coefficient esti- mates. A computer program called TrenDxdiagnoses trends by matching process data to a set of competing trend templates within a clinical context. The matching score of a trend template hypothesis is based on the mean absolute percentage error between the regression models and the data. TrenDx not only maintains alternate hypotheses of different trends, but also optimizes over different chronologies within each trend description. Therefore TrenDx can report both what the most significant trend is and when events and phases take place within that trend.

The thesis describes how TrenDx can be extended to complete an architecture for automated diagnostic process monitoring. A faulty trend is judged significant if over time it matches process data better than the expected trend. Significance of a faulty trend may trigger an alarm, switch the clinical context, or filter data for an intelligent display.

TrenDx has been applied to diagnosis of trends in two medical domains. The program diagnoses trends in pediatric growth from heights, weights, bone ages, and sexual staging data. TrenDx also detects trends in intensive care unit patients from hemodynamic and respiratory data. The techniques of TrenDx are intended as general purpose, and may be applicable to other diagnostic monitoring applications such as industrial process control, telecommunications, economics, and finance.},

	abstract = {In this thesis, I create solutions to two problems. In the first, I address the problem that many machine learning models are not interpretable, by creating a new form of classifier, called the Falling Rule List. This is a decision list classifier where the predicted probabilities are decreasing down the list. Experiments show that the gain in interpretability need not be accompanied by a large sacrifice in accuracy on real world datasets. I then briefly discuss possible extensions that allow one to directly optimize rank statistics over rule lists, and handle ordinal data. In the second, I address a shortcoming of a popular approach to handling covariate shift, in which the training distribution and that for which predictions need to be made have different covariate distributions. In particular, the existing importance weighting approach to handling covariate shift suffers from high variance if the two covariate distributions are very different. I develop a dimension reduction procedure that reduces this variance, at the expense of increased bias. Experiments show that this tradeoff can be worthwhile in some situations.},

For example, assigning properties not envisioned by the database administrator or the software engineer such as "good music to listen to when I am in a bad mood" or "excellent sushi place for taking foreign guests" is difficult in most programs because schemas are often cast in stone by a compiler or database management system. Relationships between objects in the same program or different programs, such as "Bob is Mary's brother" or "this report is relevant to next week's meeting", are similarly difficult to specify, since programs either fail to expose their object models to each other, or their object models are not fine-grained enough. If computers cannot record connective meta-data-the "glue" we use for keeping track of things-information overload will eventually prevent users from taking full advantage of information technology.We claim that by using a semistructured data model, the system can capture the context and circumstances underlying information and not simply the information itself and thus help to elucidate the relevance of the information for the user and others. To demonstrate the efficacy of our semistructured data model (based on semantic networks) and explore its consequences to the user interface, a system named Haystack has been built that permits users to store their information in a flexible fashion that can adapt to their needs. Haystack also coalesces previously segregated sources of the user's information, describes the data found in these sources using our rich description framework, and explores new means and synergies for creating, displaying, and sharing this information. The thesis begins with a motivation of the problem space and a tour of our system and then delves into the details of our user interface paradigm and other higher level concepts we believe will be helpful for those designing future information environments.},

	abstract = {Uplift modeling refers to the problem where we need to identify from a set of treatments the candidate that leads to the most desirable outcome based on subject characteristics. Most work in the last century focus on the average effect of a treatment across a population of interest, but ignores subject heterogeneity which is very common in real world. Recently there has been explosion of empirical settings which makes it possible to infer individualized treatment responses. We first consider the problem with data from randomized experiments. We put forward an unbiased estimate of the expected response, which makes it possible to evaluate an uplift model with multiple treatments. This is the first evaluation metric of uplift models aligning with the problem objective in the literature. Based on this evaluation metric, we design an ensemble tree-based algorithm (CTS) for uplift modeling. The splitting criterion and termination conditions are derived with the consideration of the special structure of uplift modeling problem. Experimental results on synthetic data and industry data show the advantage of our specialized uplift modeling algorithm over separate model approach and other existing uplift modeling algorithms. We next prove the asymptotic properties of a simplified CTS algorithm. The exhaustive search for locally optimal splitting points makes it difficult to theoretically analyze tree-based algorithms. Thus we adopt dyadic splits to CTS algorithm and obtain the bound of regret-expectation of performance difference between oracle and our algorithm. The convergence rate of the regret depends on the feature dimension, which emphasizes the importance of feature selection. While model performance usually improves with the number of features, it requires exponentially more data to approximate the optimal treatment rule. Choosing the appropriate complexity of the model and selecting the most powerful features are critical to achieving desirable performance. Finally we study the uplift modeling problem in the context of observational studies. In observational studies. treatment selection is influenced by subject characteristics. As a result. baseline characteristics often differ systematically between different treatments. Thus confounding factors need to be untangled before valid predictions are made. We combine a modification of the standard feed-forward architecture with our CTS algorithm to optimize predictive accuracy and minimize feature distribution distance between treatment. Experimental results on synthetic data show that the combination of neural network feature representation and ensemble tree-based model is promising to handle real-world problems},

	type = {PhD Thesis},

	year = {2019},
	abstract = {Personal digital assistants such as Siri, Cortana, and Alexa must translate a user's natural language query into a semantic representation that the back-end can then use to retrieve information from relevant data sources. For example, answering a user's question about the number of calories in a food requires querying a database with nutrition facts for various foods. In this thesis, we demonstrate deep learning techniques for performing a semantic mapping from raw, unstructured, human natural language directly to a structured, relational database, without any intermediate pre-processing steps or string matching heuristics. Specifically, we show that a novel, weakly supervised convolutional neural architecture learns a shared latent space, where vector representations of natural language queries lie close to embeddings of database entries that have semantically similar meanings. The first instantiation of this technology is in the nutrition domain, with the goal of reducing the burden on individuals monitoring their food intake to support healthy eating or manage their weight. To train the models, we collected 31,712 written and 2,962 spoken meal descriptions that were weakly annotated with only information about which database foods were described in the meal, but not explicitly where they were mentioned. Our best deep learning models achieve 95.8\% average semantic tagging F1 score on a held-out test set of spoken meal descriptions, and 97.1\% top-5 food database recall in a fully deployed iOS application. We also observed a significant correlation between data logged by our system and that recorded during a 24-hour dietary recall conducted by expert nutritionists in a pilot study with 14 participants. Finally, we show that our approach generalizes beyond nutrition and database mapping to other tasks such as dialogue state tracking.},
