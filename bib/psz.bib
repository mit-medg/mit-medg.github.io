Concluding that the current practices at the majority of health care facilities in the United States are insufficient, the Council delineated both technical and organizational approaches to protecting electronic health information. The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recently implemented a proof-of-concept, Web-based, cross-institutional medical record, CareWeb, which incorporates the NRC security and confidentiality recommendations. We report on our WWW implementation of the NRC recommendations and an initial evaluation of the balance between ease of use and confidentiality.},

It is hoped that other, similar efforts now underway will be able to use and build on this model. Comment on this proposal is invited from all parties with an interest in confidentiality. The system will be used only with ``scrubbed'' data-data from which all identifiers have been removed-until it is generally agreed that the confidentiality methods proposed here are appropriate and sufficient.},

JAMI inherited several design decisions from the first W3-EMRS implementation described in, including using the Web as the communication infrastructure and HL7 as the communication protocol between the heterogeneous systems and the W3-EMRS systems. In addition, JAMI incorporates the growing Java technologies and has a more flexible and efficient architecture. This paper describes JAMI's architecture and implementation. It also present two instances of JAMI, one for the integration of different hospital information systems and another for the integration of two heterogeneous systems within a single hospital. Some important issues for the further development of JAMI, including security and confidentiality, data input and decision support are discussed.},

Unique system designs coupled with a lack of standards have led to this difficulty. The authors have designed a preliminary EMRS architecture (W3-EMRS) that exploits the multiplatform, multiprotocol, client-server technology of the World Wide Web. The architecture abstracts the clinical information model and the visual presentation away from the underlying EMRS. As a result, computation upon data elements of the EMRS and their presentation are no longer tied to the underlying EMRS structures. The architecture is intended to enable implementation of programs that provide uniform access to multiple, heterogeneous legacy EMRSs. The authors have implemented an initial prototype of W3-EMRS that accesses the database of the Boston Children's Hospital Clinician's Workstation.},

Decision making is presented from the decision analysis viewpoint, with brief mention of recently-developed methods. The paper concludes with review of more abstract characterization of uncertainty, and anticipates the growing importance of analytic and ``data mining'' techniques as growing amounts of clinical data become widely available.}}

Hopes that such a strategy would lead to clinically useful programs have not been fulfilled, but many of the problems impeding creation of effective artificial intelligence programs have been solved. Strategies have been developed to limit the number of hypotheses that a program must consider and to incorporate pathophysiologic reasoning. The latter innovation permits a program to analyze cases in which one disorder influences the presentation of another. Prototypes embodying such reasoning can explain their conclusions in medical terms that can be reviewed by the user. Despite these advances, further major research and developmental efforts will be necessary before expert performance by the computer becomes a reality.},
