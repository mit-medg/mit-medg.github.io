	abstract = {Introduction: The rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare presents significant governance challenges, requiring balanced approaches that safeguard safety, efficacy, equity, and trust (SEET). This study proposes a cognitive framework to guide AI governance, addressing tradeoffs between speed, scope, and capability. Objective: To develop a structured governance model that harmonizes stakeholder perspectives, focusing on multi-dimensional challenges and ethical principles essential for AI in healthcare. Methods: A multidisciplinary team convened at the Blueprints for Trust conference, organized by the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA), and the Division of Clinical Informatics at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Following extensive discussions with 190 participants across sectors, three governance models were identified to address specific domains: (1) Clinical Decision Support (CDS), (2) Real-World Evidence (RWE), (3) Consumer Health (CH). Results: Three governance models emerged, tailored to CDS, RWE, and CH domains. Key recommendations include establishing a Health AI Consumer Consortium for patient-centered oversight, initiating voluntary accreditation and certification frameworks, and piloting risk-level-based standards. These models balance rapid adaptation with SEET-focused safeguards through transparency, inclusivity, and ongoing learning. Conclusion: A proactive, constraint-based governance framework is critical for responsible AI integration in healthcare. This structured, multi-stakeholder approach provides a roadmap for ethical, transparent governance that can evolve with technological advancements, enhancing trust and safety in healthcare AI applications.},

We have a very limited understanding of why they work well at all or of the circumstances under which they give incorrect responses. This suggests the need for additional research and great caution in deploying such models for critical applications. Since the availability of ChatGPT in late 2022, based on OpenAI's GPT 3.5 large language model, those of us who have explored its capabilities have been amazed by its facility with language and its abilities to generate coherent --- and even insightful --- synopses; answer questions about everything from general knowledge to domain-specific topics; offer advice on how to accomplish tasks, including for medical diagnosis, therapy, and prognosis; deduce consequences of assumptions; and even write effective computer programs. Nevertheless, I would urge great caution in adopting such methods in health care, mainly because of our lack of understanding of how they accomplish the miraculous-seeming things they are able to do.},

In our study, we conduct an exploratory evaluation of users' AI-advice accepting behavior when evaluating the truthfulness of a health-related statement in different "advice quality" settings. We find that even feedback that is confined to just stating that "the AI thinks that the statement is false/true" results in more than half of people moving their statement veracity assessment towards the AI suggestion. The different types of advice given influence the acceptance rates, but the sheer effect of getting a suggestion is often bigger than the suggestion-type effect.},

	abstract = {Abstract                        Background             Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 hold great promise as transformative tools in healthcare, ranging from automating administrative tasks to augmenting clinical decision- making. However, these models also pose a serious danger of perpetuating biases and delivering incorrect medical diagnoses, which can have a direct, harmful impact on medical care.                                   Methods             Using the Azure OpenAI API, we tested whether GPT-4 encodes racial and gender biases and examined the impact of such biases on four potential applications of LLMs in the clinical domain\textemdash namely, medical education, diagnostic reasoning, plan generation, and patient assessment. We conducted experiments with prompts designed to resemble typical use of GPT-4 within clinical and medical education applications. We used clinical vignettes from NEJM Healer and from published research on implicit bias in healthcare. GPT-4 estimates of the demographic distribution of medical conditions were compared to true U.S. prevalence estimates. Differential diagnosis and treatment planning were evaluated across demographic groups using standard statistical tests for significance between groups.                                   Findings             We find that GPT-4 does not appropriately model the demographic diversity of medical conditions, consistently producing clinical vignettes that stereotype demographic presentations. The differential diagnoses created by GPT-4 for standardized clinical vignettes were more likely to include diagnoses that stereotype certain races, ethnicities, and gender identities. Assessment and plans created by the model showed significant association between demographic attributes and recommendations for more expensive procedures as well as differences in patient perception.                                   Interpretation             Our findings highlight the urgent need for comprehensive and transparent bias assessments of LLM tools like GPT-4 for every intended use case before they are integrated into clinical care. We discuss the potential sources of these biases and potential mitigation strategies prior to clinical implementation.},

	abstract = {Although recent advances in scaling large language models (LLMs) have resulted in improvements on many NLP tasks, it remains unclear whether these models trained primarily with general web text are the right tool in highly specialized, safety critical domains such as clinical text. Recent results have suggested that LLMs encode a surprising amount of medical knowledge. This raises an important question regarding the utility of smaller domain-specific language models. With the success of general-domain LLMs, is there still a need for specialized clinical models? To investigate this question, we conduct an extensive empirical analysis of 12 language models, ranging from 220M to 175B parameters, measuring their performance on 3 different clinical tasks that test their ability to parse and reason over electronic health records. As part of our experiments, we train T5-Base and T5-Large models from scratch on clinical notes from MIMIC III and IV to directly investigate the efficiency of clinical tokens. We show that relatively small specialized clinical models substantially outperform all in-context learning approaches, even when finetuned on limited annotated data. Further, we find that pretraining on clinical tokens allows for smaller, more parameter-efficient models that either match or outperform much larger language models trained on general text. We release the code and the models used under the PhysioNet Credentialed Health Data license and data use agreement.},

Concurrently, these factors also dramatically increase the difficulty in developing NLP models in multi-site settings, which is necessary for algorithm robustness and generalizability. Here, we reported on our experience developing an NLP solution for COVID-19 signs and symptom extraction in an open NLP framework from a subset of sites participating in the National COVID Cohort (N3C). We then empirically highlight the benefits of multi-site data for both symbolic and statistical methods, as well as highlight the need for federated annotation and evaluation to resolve several pitfalls encountered in the course of these efforts.},

This deep dive is meant to serve as a cautionary tale to encourage every data scientist to approach their projects with the humility to know what they can do well and what they cannot. Our hope is that this case study illustrates that common sense assumptions are insufficient for working in highly specialized fields. Without the guidance of stakeholders that understand the data generating process, data scientists run the risk of ``garbage-in, garbage-out'' analysis because their models are not measuring meaningful relationships.},

Attempts to capture the methods of medical reasoning in computer programs developed a variety of representations for such knowledge, ranging from inference rules to prototype descriptions to probabilistic models that incorporate utilities. There has been a recent surge in interest to incorporate medical knowledge into modern machine learning frameworks. This chapter discusses how knowledge can be incorporated into machine learning models implicitly, via choice of architecture, training data, or loss function, and explicitly, via external knowledge graphs or text data.},

	year = {2022},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many U.S. institutions have adopted postsurgical opioid-prescribing guidelines to standardize prescribing practices, and yet there is inherent variability in patients' opioid consumption after surgery. The utility of these guidelines is limited by the fact that some patients' needs will inevitably exceed them, and yet there are no evidence-based tools to help providers identify these patients. In this study we aimed to maximize the value of these guidelines by training machine learning models to predict patients whose needs will be met by these smaller recommended prescriptions, and patients who may require an additional degree of personalization. The aim of the present study was to develop predictive models for determining whether a surgical patient's postdischarge opioid requirement will fall above or below common opioid prescribing guidelines.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of surgical patients at one institution from 2017 to 2018. Patients were called after discharge to collect opioid consumption data. Machine learning models were used to identify outlier opioid consumers (ie, exceeding our institutional prescribing guidelines) using diagnosis codes, medical history, in-hospital opioid use, and perioperative factors as predictors. External validation was performed on opioid consumption data collected at a second institution from 2020 to 2021, and sensitivity analysis was performed using a third institution's prescribing guidelines.
RESULTS: The development and external validation cohorts included 1,867 and 498 patients, respectively. Age, body mass index, tobacco use, preoperative opioid exposure, and in-hospital opioid consumption were the strongest predictors of postdischarge consumption. A lasso regression model exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.74 (95% confidence interval 0.67-0.81) in predicting postdischarge opioid consumption. External validation of a limited lasso model yielded an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.67 (0.60-0.74). Performance was preserved when evaluated on another institution's guidelines (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.76 [0.72-0.80]).
CONCLUSION: Patient characteristics reliably predict postdischarge opioid consumption in relation to prescribing guidelines for both opioid-naive and exposed populations. This model may be used to help providers confidently follow prescribing guidelines for patients with typical opioid responsiveness and correctly pursue more personalized prescribing for others.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of large collections of electronic health record (EHR) data and unprecedented technical advances in deep learning (DL) have sparked a surge of research interest in developing DL based clinical decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. Despite the recognition of the value of deep learning in healthcare, impediments to further adoption in real healthcare settings remain due to the black-box nature of DL. Therefore, there is an emerging need for interpretable DL, which allows end users to evaluate the model decision making to know whether to accept or reject predictions and recommendations before an action is taken. In this review, we focus on the interpretability of the DL models in healthcare. We start by introducing the methods for interpretability in depth and comprehensively as a methodological reference for future researchers or clinical practitioners in this field. Besides the methods' details, we also include a discussion of advantages and disadvantages of these methods and which scenarios each of them is suitable for, so that interested readers can know how to compare and choose among them for use. Moreover, we discuss how these methods, originally developed for solving general-domain problems, have been adapted and applied to healthcare problems and how they can help physicians better understand these data-driven technologies. Overall, we hope this survey can help researchers and practitioners in both artificial intelligence and clinical fields understand what methods we have for enhancing the interpretability of their DL models and choose the optimal one accordingly.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been linked to severe clinical outcomes among people who are hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We tested the hypothesis that visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is associated with severe outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, independent of body mass index (BMI). METHODS: We analyzed data from the Massachusetts General Hospital COVID-19 Data Registry, which included patients admitted with polymerase chain reaction-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from March 11 to May 4, 2020. We used a validated, fully automated artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm to quantify VAT from computed tomography (CT) scans during or before the hospital admission. VAT quantification took an average of 2 ± 0.5 seconds per patient. We dichotomized VAT as high and low at a threshold of ≥100 cm(2) and used Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazards regression to assess the relationship between VAT and death or intubation over 28 days, adjusting for age, sex, race, BMI, and diabetes status. RESULTS: A total of 378 participants had CT imaging. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that participants with high VAT had a greater risk of the outcome compared with those with low VAT (P < .005), especially in those with BMI <30 kg/m(2) (P < .005). In multivariable models, the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for high vs low VAT was unchanged (aHR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.24-3.09), whereas BMI was no longer significant (aHR for obese vs normal BMI, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.71-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: High VAT is associated with a greater risk of severe disease or death in COVID-19 and can offer more precise information to risk-stratify individuals beyond BMI. AI offers a promising approach to routinely ascertain VAT and improve clinical risk prediction in COVID-19.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Body composition is associated with mortality; however its routine assessment is too time-consuming. PURPOSE: To demonstrate the value of artificial intelligence (AI) to extract body composition measures from routine studies, we aimed to develop a fully automated AI approach to measure fat and muscles masses, to validate its clinical discriminatory value, and to provide the code, training data and workflow solutions to facilitate its integration into local practice. METHODS: We developed a neural network that quantified the tissue components at the L3 vertebral body level using data from the Liver Tumor Challenge (LiTS) and a pancreatic cancer cohort. We classified sarcopenia using accepted skeletal muscle index cut-offs and visceral fat based its median value. We used Kaplan Meier curves and Cox regression analysis to assess the association between these measures and mortality. RESULTS: Applying the algorithm trained on LiTS data to the local cohort yielded good agreement [>0.8 intraclass correlation (ICC)]; when trained on both datasets, it had excellent agreement (>0.9 ICC). The pancreatic cancer cohort had 136 patients (mean age: 67 ± 11 years; 54% women); 15% had sarcopenia; mean visceral fat was 142 cm(2). Concurrent with prior research, we found a significant association between sarcopenia and mortality [mean survival of 15 ± 12 vs. 22 ± 12 (p < 0.05), adjusted HR of 1.58 (95% CI: 1.03-3.33)] but no association between visceral fat and mortality. The detector analysis took 1 ± 0.5 s. CONCLUSIONS: AI body composition analysis can provide meaningful imaging biomarkers from routine exams demonstrating AI's ability to further enhance the clinical value of radiology reports.},

	year = {2021},
	abstract = {Objective: Large amounts of health data are becoming available for biomedical research. Synthesizing information across databases may capture more comprehensive pictures of patient health and enable novel research studies. When no gold standard mappings between patient records are available, researchers may probabilistically link records from separate databases and analyze the linked data. However, previous linked data inference methods are constrained to certain linkage settings and exhibit low power. Here, we present ATLAS, an automated, flexible, and robust association testing algorithm for probabilistically linked data. Materials and Methods: Missing variables are imputed at various thresholds using a weighted average method that propagates uncertainty from probabilistic linkage. Next, estimated effect sizes are obtained using a generalized linear model. ATLAS then conducts the threshold combination test by optimally combining P values obtained from data imputed at varying thresholds using Fisher’s method and perturbation resampling. Results: In simulations, ATLAS controls for type I error and exhibits high power compared to previous methods. In a real-world genetic association study, meta-analysis of ATLAS-enabled analyses on a linked cohort with analyses using an existing cohort yielded additional significant associations between rheumatoid arthritis genetic risk score and laboratory biomarkers. Discussion: Weighted average imputation weathers false matches and increases contribution of true matches to mitigate linkage error-induced bias. The threshold combination test avoids arbitrarily choosing a threshold to rule a match, thus automating linked data-enabled analyses and preserving power. Conclusion: ATLAS promises to enable novel and powerful research studies using linked data to capitalize on all available data sources.},

Methods: We annotated a data set of 64 patients with neuroendocrine tumors who underwent at least two consecutive liver MRIs with gadoxetic acid. We then developed a 3-D neural network using a U-Net architecture with ResNet-18 building blocks that first detected the liver and then lesions within the liver. Liver lesion labels for each examination were then matched in 3-D space using an iterative closest point algorithm followed by Kuhn-Munkres algorithm. Results: We developed a deep learning algorithm that detected liver metastases, co-registered the detected lesions, and then assessed the interval change in tumor burden between two multiparametric liver MRI examinations. Our deep learning algorithm was concordant in 91\% with the radiologists' manual assessment about the interval change of disease burden. It had a sensitivity of 0.85 (95\% confidence interval (95\% CI): 0.77; 0.93) and specificity of 0.92 (95\% CI: 0.87; 0.96) to classify liver segments as diseased or healthy. The mean DICE coefficient for individual lesions ranged between 0.73 and 0.81. Conclusions: Our algorithm displayed high agreement with human readers for detecting change in liver lesions on MRI, offering evidence that artificial intelligence-based detectors may perform these tasks as part of routine clinical care in the future.},

	abstract = {We propose and demonstrate a novel machine learning algorithm that assesses pulmonary edema severity from chest radiographs. While large publicly available datasets of chest radiographs and free-text radiology reports exist, only limited numerical edema severity labels can be extracted from radiology reports. This is a significant challenge in learning such models for image classification. To take advantage of the rich information present in the radiology reports, we develop a neural network model that is trained on both images and free-text to assess pulmonary edema severity from chest radiographs at inference time. Our experimental results suggest that the joint image-text representation learning improves the performance of pulmonary edema assessment compared to a supervised model trained on images only. We also show the use of the text for explaining the image classification by the joint model. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to leverage free-text radiology reports for improving the image model performance in this application.

	abstract = {With advances in deep learning and image captioning over the past few years, researchers have recently begun applying computer vision methods to radiology report generation. Typically, these generated reports have been evaluated using general domain natural lan- guage generation (NLG) metrics like CIDEr and BLEU. However, there is little work as- sessing how appropriate these metrics are for healthcare, where correctness is critically important. In this work, we profile a number of models for automatic report generation on this dataset, including: random report retrieval, nearest neighbor report retrieval, n- gram language models, and neural network approaches. These models serve to calibrate our understanding for what the opaque general domain NLG metrics mean. In particular, we find that the standard NLG metrics (e.g. BLEU, CIDEr) actually assign higher scores to random (but grammatical) clinical sentences over n-gram-derived sentences, despite the n-gram sentences achieving higher clinical accuracy. This casts doubt on the usefulness of these domain-agnostic metrics, though unsurprisingly we find that the best performance -- on both CIDEr/BLEU and clinical correctness -- was achieved by more sophisticated models.},

	year = {2020},
	abstract = {MOTIVATION: In evidence-based medicine (EBM), defining a clinical question in terms of the specific patient problem aids the physicians to efficiently identify appropriate resources and search for the best available evidence for medical treatment. In order to formulate a well-defined, focused clinical question, a framework called PICO is widely used, which identifies the sentences in a given medical text that belong to the four components typically reported in clinical trials: Participants/Problem (P), Intervention (I), Comparison (C) and Outcome (O). In this work, we propose a novel deep learning model for recognizing PICO elements in biomedical abstracts. Based on the previous state-of-the-art bidirectional long-short term memory (biLSTM) plus conditional random field (CRF) architecture, we add another layer of biLSTM upon the sentence representation vectors so that the contextual information from surrounding sentences can be gathered to help infer the interpretation of the current one. In addition, we propose two methods to further generalize and improve the model: adversarial training and unsupervised pre-training over large corpora.
RESULTS: We tested our proposed approach over two benchmark datasets. One is the PubMed-PICO dataset, where our best results outperform the previous best by 5.5\%, 7.9\%, and 5.8\% for P, I, and O elements in terms of F1 score, respectively. And for the other dataset named NICTA-PIBOSO, the improvements for P/I/O elements are 3.9\%, 15.6\%, and 1.3\% in F1 score, respectively. Overall, our proposed deep learning model can obtain unprecedented PICO element detection accuracy while avoiding the need for any manual feature selection.
AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Code is available at https://github.com/jind11/Deep-PICO-Detection.

	abstract = {Phenotypes are the foundation for clinical and genetic studies of disease risk and outcomes. The growth of biobanks linked to electronic medical record (EMR) data has both facilitated and increased the demand for efficient, accurate, and robust approaches for phenotyping millions of patients. Challenges to phenotyping with EMR data include variation in the accuracy of codes, as well as the high level of manual input required to identify features for the algorithm and to obtain gold standard labels. To address these challenges, we developed PheCAP, a high-throughput semi-supervised phenotyping pipeline. PheCAP begins with data from the EMR, including structured data and information extracted from the narrative notes using natural language processing (NLP). The standardized steps integrate automated procedures, which reduce the level of manual input, and machine learning approaches for algorithm training. PheCAP itself can be executed in 1-2 d if all data are available; however, the timing is largely dependent on the chart review stage, which typically requires at least 2 weeks. The final products of PheCAP include a phenotype algorithm, the probability of the phenotype for all patients, and a phenotype classification (yes or no).},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Electronic health records linked with biorepositories are a powerful platform for translational studies. A major bottleneck exists in the ability to phenotype patients accurately and efficiently. The objective of this study was to develop an automated high-throughput phenotyping method integrating International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We developed a mapping method for automatically identifying relevant ICD and NLP concepts for a specific phenotype leveraging the Unified Medical Language System. Along with health care utilization, aggregated ICD and NLP counts were jointly analyzed by fitting an ensemble of latent mixture models. The multimodal automated phenotyping (MAP) algorithm yields a predicted probability of phenotype for each patient and a threshold for classifying participants with phenotype yes/no. The algorithm was validated using labeled data for 16 phenotypes from a biorepository and further tested in an independent cohort phenome-wide association studies (PheWAS) for 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with known associations.
RESULTS: The MAP algorithm achieved higher or similar AUC and F-scores compared to the ICD code across all 16 phenotypes. The features assembled via the automated approach had comparable accuracy to those assembled via manual curation (AUCMAP 0.943, AUCmanual 0.941). The PheWAS results suggest that the MAP approach detected previously validated associations with higher power when compared to the standard PheWAS method based on ICD codes.
CONCLUSION: The MAP approach increased the accuracy of phenotype definition while maintaining scalability, thereby facilitating use in studies requiring large-scale phenotyping, such as PheWAS.},

	volume = {25},
	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Objective: A key challenge in clinical data mining is that most clinical datasets contain missing data. Since many commonly used machine learning algorithms require complete datasets (no missing data), clinical analytic approaches often entail an imputation procedure to ``fill in'' missing data. However, although most clinical datasets contain a temporal component, most commonly used imputation methods do not adequately accommodate longitudinal time-based data. We sought to develop a new imputation algorithm, 3-dimensional multiple imputation with chained equations (3D-MICE), that can perform accurate imputation of missing clinical time series data.
Methods: We extracted clinical laboratory test results for 13 commonly measured analytes (clinical laboratory tests). We imputed missing test results for the 13 analytes using 3 imputation methods: multiple imputation with chained equations (MICE), Gaussian process (GP), and 3D-MICE. 3D-MICE utilizes both MICE and GP imputation to integrate cross-sectional and longitudinal information. To evaluate imputation method performance, we randomly masked selected test results and imputed these masked results alongside results missing from our original data. We compared predicted results to measured results for masked data points.
Results: 3D-MICE performed significantly better than MICE and GP-based imputation in a composite of all 13 analytes, predicting missing results with a normalized root-mean-square error of 0.342, compared to 0.373 for MICE alone and 0.358 for GP alone.
Conclusions: 3D-MICE offers a novel and practical approach to imputing clinical laboratory time series data. 3D-MICE may provide an additional tool for use as a foundation in clinical predictive analytics and intelligent clinical decision support.},

Each of these users has his own particular, idiosyncratic problems.
 The computer should be an effective tool for him in dealing
 with these problems. Our methodology is designed to provide
 each of these users with an appropriate interface to the computer, with a language which is natural to his view of reality. 
 
 In this paper we examine the nature of today's ubiquitous
 applications packages, discuss our notion of applications languages and present some of our experience with the REL system, which has been designed to incorporate our views on specialized user languages.},

	abstract = {The principal investigator (PI)-IN-A-BOX knowledge based system helps astronauts perform science experiments in space. These experiments are typically costly to devise and build and often are difficult to perform. Further, the space laboratory environment is unique; ever changing; hectic; and, therefore, stressful. The environment requires quick, correct reactions to events over a wide range of experiments and disciplines, including ones distant from an astronaut's main science specialty. This environment suggests the use of advanced techniques for data collection, analysis, and decision making to maximize the value of the research performed. PI-IN-A-BOX aids astronauts with quick-look data collection, reduction, and analysis as well as equipment diagnosis and troubleshooting, procedural reminders, and suggestions for high-value departures from the preplanned experiment protocol. The astronauts have direct access to the system, which is hosted on a portable computer in the Space Lab module. The system is in use on the ground for mission training and was used in flight during the October 1993 space life sciences 2 (SLS-2) shuttle mission.

	abstract = {In this paper we propose a new approach to probabilistic inference on belief networks, global conditioning, which is a simple generalization of Pearl's (1986b) method of loop-cutset conditioning. We show that global conditioning, as well as loop-cutset conditioning, can be thought of as a special case of the method of Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter (1988) as refined by Jensen et al (1990a; 1990b). Nonetheless, this approach provides new opportunities for parallel processing and, in the case of sequential processing, a tradeoff of time for memory. We also show how a hybrid method (Suermondt and others 1990) combining loop-cutset conditioning with Jensen's method can be viewed within our framework. By exploring the relationships between these methods, we develop a unifying framework in which the advantages of each approach can be combined successfully.},

	abstract = {Notions of signature and anomaly have formed the basis of useful methods in cyber defense, but even in combination provide only weak evidence for recognizing many events of interest. One can recognize many important events without requiring signatures of specific ways the events can take place and without treating every anomalous behavior as an event. We describe an approach to event recognition that subsumes and extends signature and anomaly methods by starting from a richer language for characterizing events. This paper explains how recognition methods based on this richer event-characterization language offer means for overcoming the limitations constraining signature and anomaly methods. I. Signature and anomaly methods NOTIONS of signature and anomaly form the backbone.},

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {Summary: We demonstrate several advantages of applying data mining techniques on time-dependent Electronic Medical Records (EMR), specifically: 1) combining structured and unstructured variables improves the accuracy of a type-2 diabetes (T2D) classification algorithm, 2) conducting a quantitative survey of multiple comorbidities is important in T2D especially cardiovascular complications with hazard ratios, 3) analyzing time dependent variables can clarify time dependent contributions to variety of comorbidities, and specifically of the {\textquotedblleft}obesity paradox{\textquotedblright}, and 4) demonstrating that an unbiased examination of physician treatment patterns reveals changes over time consistent with clinical trials.
\&nbsp;
Background: Cohorts assembled from EMR present a potentially powerful resource to study T2D and cardiovascular complications at population scale. Recent reports have demonstrated the utility of EMR analysis to discover genotype-phenotype correlations, sub-categories of disease, and adverse drug events.
\&nbsp;
Methods: We developed a classification algorithm to identify T2D patients based on characteristics including clinical notes, diagnosis and procedure codes, medications, and laboratory tests. We analyzed an EMR database at MGH and BWH considering patients who received care between 1990 - 2013. We applied logistic regression with the adaptive LASSO using different combinations of variables such as structured variables only, unstructured variables only, and combination of all variables. To determine the level of association between clinical and demographic variables with mortality we developed baseline and lagged-time varying Cox regression models that included an adjustment to ethnicity and time varying covariates. To observe at changes in frequency ratios of medical concepts as a function of time, considering also the effects of clinical trials publications, we focus on heart failure related concepts extracted from clinical notes (e.g., Aldosterone, Biventricular Pacemaker). To assess how therapeutic relationships change over time, we calculated sparse covariance matrices.
\&nbsp;
Results: Our classification algorithm identified 65,099 T2D patients with a specificity of 97\% and PPV of 96\%. The definition of {\textquotedblleft}gold standard{\textquotedblright} included >= 1 measurements of HGB A1C >= 6.5\% among other criteria. 56,691 patients (87.1\%) had two and 38,449 patients (59.1\%) had four or more chronic conditions, demonstrating the complexity of the cohort that we created in comparison with administrative claims databases that lack many clinical details. Cox regression models indicated statistically significant HRs $> 1$ for CHF, CAD, and CVD, and HRs $< 1$ for PCI and CABG. HRs for BMI were particularly interesting as increasing levels were associated with significant lower mortality as compared to the reference BMI (\&lt; 25 kg/m2). Further stratifying the results into 1, 3 and 5 years analysis, this {\textquotedblleft}obesity paradox{\textquotedblright} is strikingly obvious at short-term follow-up of 1 year. It may be due to the fact that patients with low BMI were suffering from chronic medical conditions (e.g., malignancy or inflammatory conditions) increasing their 1 year mortality. However, at 3 and 5 years follow-up, we do see increase in mortality with increasing BMI levels likely related to increase in the burden of cardiovascular events.
\&nbsp;
Discussion: We implemented classification, prediction, and natural language processing techniques in multiple scenarios to create and to analyze a highly complex and large cohort, to aid understanding better patients, time-dependent entities digitally represented as a collection of data elements.},

	abstract = {This paper describes an ongoing expert system development effort started in 1988 which is evaluating both CLIPS- and LISP- based approaches. The expert system is being developed to a project schedule and is planned for flight on Space Shuttle Mission SLS-2 in 1992. The expert system will help astronauts do the best possible science for a vestibular physiology experiment already scheduled for that mission. The system gathers and reduces data from the experiment, flags 'interesting' results, and proposes changes in the experiment both to exploit the in-flight observations and to stay within the time allowed by Mission Control for the experiment. These tasks must all be performed in real time. Two Apple Macintosh computers are used. The CLIPS- and LISP- based environments are layered above the Macintosh computer Operating System. The 'CLIPS-based' environment includes CLIPS and HyperCard. The LlSP-based environment includes Common LISP, Parmenides (a frame system), and FRuleKit (a rule system). Important evaluation factors include ease of programming, performance against real-time requirements, usability by an astronaut, robustness, and ease of maintenance. Current results on the factors of ease of programming, performance against real-time requirements, and ease of maintenance are discussed.}}

	abstract = {The onset of acute kidney injury (AKI) during an intensive care unit (ICU) admission is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Developing novel methods to identify early AKI onset is of critical importance in preventing or reducing AKI complications. We built and applied multiple machine learning models to integrate clinical notes and structured physiological measurements and estimate the risk of new AKI onset using the MIMIC-III database. From the clinical notes, we generated clinically meaningful word representations and embeddings. Four supervised learning classifiers and mixed-feature deep learning architecture were used to construct prediction models. The best configurations consistently utilized both structured and unstructured clinical features and yielded competitive AUCs above 0.83. Our work suggests that integrating structured and unstructured clinical features can be effectively applied to assist clinicians in identifying the risk of incident AKI onset in critically-ill patients upon admission to the ICU.},

	abstract = {Background: We re-analyzed data from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) trial to identify features of systolic blood pressure (SBP) variability that portend poor cardiovascular outcomes using a nonlinear machine-learning algorithm.
Methods: We included all patients who completed 1 year of the study without reaching any primary endpoint during the first year, specifically: myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure or death from a cardiovascular event (n = 8799; 94\%). In addition to clinical variables, features representing longitudinal SBP trends and variability were determined and combined in a random forest algorithm, optimized using cross-validation, using 70\% of patients in the training set. Area under the curve (AUC) was measured using a 30\% testing set. Finally, feature importance was determined by minimizing node impurity averaging over all trees in the forest for a specific feature.
Results: A total of 365 patients (4.1\%) reached the combined primary outcome over 37 months of follow-up. The random forest classifier had an AUC of 0.71 on the testing set. The 10 most significant features selected in order of importance by the automated algorithm included the urine albumin/creatinine (CR) ratio, estimated glomerular filtration rate, age, serum CR, history of subclinical cardiovascular disease (CVD), cholesterol, a variable representing SBP signals using wavelet transformation, high-density lipoprotein, the 90th percentile of SBP and triglyceride level.
Conclusions: We successfully demonstrated use of random forest algorithm to define best prognostic longitudinal SBP representations. In addition to known risk factors for CVD, transformed variables for time series SBP measurements were found to be important in predicting poor cardiovascular outcomes and require further evaluation.},

Methods: Two case studies are examined using a machine learning algorithm on unstructured clinical and psychiatric notes to predict intensive care unit (ICU) mortality and 30-day psychiatric readmission with respect to race, gender, and insurance payer type as a proxy for socioeconomic status.
Results: Clinical note topics and psychiatric note topics were heterogenous with respect to race, gender, and insurance payer type, which reflects known clinical findings. Differences in prediction accuracy and therefore machine bias are shown with respect to gender and insurance type for ICU mortality and with respect to insurance policy for psychiatric 30-day readmission.
Conclusions: This analysis can provide a framework for assessing and identifying disparate impacts of artificial intelligence in health care.},

It relies on Bayesian modelling of binarized diagnosis codes, and provides a posterior probability of matching for each patient pair, while considering all the data at once. Both in our simulation study (using an administrative claims dataset for data generation) and in two real use-cases linking patient electronic health records from a large tertiary care network, our method exhibits good performance and compares favourably to the standard baseline Fellegi-Sunter algorithm. We propose a scalable, fast and efficient open-source implementation in the ludic R package available on CRAN, which also includes the anonymized diagnosis code data from our real use-case. This work suggests it is possible to link de-identified research databases stripped of any personal health identifiers using only diagnosis codes, provided sufficient information is shared between the data sources.},

	abstract = {Electronic Health Records (EHRs) have seen a rapid increase in adoption during the last decade. The narrative prose contained in clinical notes is unstructured and unlocking its full potential has proved challenging. Many studies incorporating clinical notes have applied simple information extraction models to build representations that enhance a downstream clinical prediction task, such as mortality or readmission. Improved predictive performance suggests a ``good'' representation. However, these extrinsic evaluations are blind to most of the insight contained in the notes. In order to better understand the power of expressive clinical prose, we investigate both intrinsic and extrinsic methods for understanding several common note representations. To ensure replicability and to support the clinical modeling community, we run all experiments on publicly-available data and provide our code.}}

	volume = {17},
	year = {2017},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The medical subdomain of a clinical note, such as cardiology or neurology, is useful content-derived metadata for developing machine learning downstream applications. To classify the medical subdomain of a note accurately, we have constructed a machine learning-based natural language processing (NLP) pipeline and developed medical subdomain classifiers based on the content of the note.
METHODS: We constructed the pipeline using the clinical NLP system, clinical Text Analysis and Knowledge Extraction System (cTAKES), the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus, Semantic Network, and learning algorithms to extract features from two datasets - clinical notes from Integrating Data for Analysis, Anonymization, and Sharing (iDASH) data repository (n = 431) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) (n = 91,237), and built medical subdomain classifiers with different combinations of data representation methods and supervised learning algorithms. We evaluated the performance of classifiers and their portability across the two datasets.
RESULTS: The convolutional recurrent neural network with neural word embeddings trained-medical subdomain classifier yielded the best performance measurement on iDASH and MGH datasets with area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.975 and 0.991, and F1 scores of 0.845 and 0.870, respectively. Considering better clinical interpretability, linear support vector machine-trained medical subdomain classifier using hybrid bag-of-words and clinically relevant UMLS concepts as the feature representation, with term frequency-inverse document frequency (tf-idf)-weighting, outperformed other shallow learning classifiers on iDASH and MGH datasets with AUC of 0.957 and 0.964, and F1 scores of 0.932 and 0.934 respectively. We trained classifiers on one dataset, applied to the other dataset and yielded the threshold of F1 score of 0.7 in classifiers for half of the medical subdomains we studied.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that a supervised learning-based NLP approach is useful to develop medical subdomain classifiers. The deep learning algorithm with distributed word representation yields better performance yet shallow learning algorithms with the word and concept representation achieves comparable performance with better clinical interpretability. Portable classifiers may also be used across datasets from different institutions.},

	year = {2018},
	abstract = {Objective: Electronic health record (EHR)-based phenotyping infers whether a patient has a disease based on the information in his or her EHR. A human-annotated training set with gold-standard disease status labels is usually required to build an algorithm for phenotyping based on a set of predictive features. The time intensiveness of annotation and feature curation severely limits the ability to achieve high-throughput phenotyping. While previous studies have successfully automated feature curation, annotation remains a major bottleneck. In this paper, we present PheNorm, a phenotyping algorithm that does not require expert-labeled samples for training.
Methods: The most predictive features, such as the number of International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes or mentions of the target phenotype, are normalized to resemble a normal mixture distribution with high area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) for prediction. The transformed features are then denoised and combined into a score for accurate disease classification.
Results: We validated the accuracy of PheNorm with 4 phenotypes: coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis. The AUCs of the PheNorm score reached 0.90, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.94 for the 4 phenotypes, respectively, which were comparable to the accuracy of supervised algorithms trained with sample sizes of 100-300, with no statistically significant difference.
Conclusion: The accuracy of the PheNorm algorithms is on par with algorithms trained with annotated samples. PheNorm fully automates the generation of accurate phenotyping algorithms and demonstrates the capacity for EHR-driven annotations to scale to the next level - phenotypic big data.},

	abstract = {We propose Segment Convolutional Neural Networks (Seg-CNNs) for classifying relations from clinical notes. Seg-CNNs use only word-embedding features without manual feature engineering. Unlike typical CNN models, relations between 2 concepts are identified by simultaneously learning separate representations for text segments in a sentence: preceding, concept1, middle, concept2, and succeeding. We evaluate Seg-CNN on the i2b2/VA relation classification challenge dataset. We show that Seg-CNN achieves a state-of-the-art micro-average F-measure of 0.742 for overall evaluation, 0.686 for classifying medical problem-treatment relations, 0.820 for medical problem-test relations, and 0.702 for medical problem-medical problem relations. We demonstrate the benefits of learning segment-level representations. We show that medical domain word embeddings help improve relation classification. Seg-CNNs can be trained quickly for the i2b2/VA dataset on a graphics processing unit (GPU) platform. These results support the use of CNNs computed over segments of text for classifying medical relations, as they show state-of-the-art performance while requiring no manual feature engineering.},

We compare our learned states to static demographics and raw vital signs in the prediction of five ICU treatments: ventilation, vasopressor administra tion, and three transfusions. We show that our learned states, when combined with demographics and raw vital signs, improve prediction for most interventions even 4 or 8 hours ahead of onset. Our results are competitive with existing work while using a substantially larger and more diverse cohort of 36,050 patients. While custom classifiers can only target a specific clinical event, our model learns physiological states which can help with many interventions. Our robust patient state representations provide a path towards evidence-driven administration of clinical interventions.}}

OBJECTIVE: We seek to study the manifestations of PH in children and to assess the feasibility of applying a network-based approach to discern disease subtypes from comorbidity data recorded in longitudinal data sets.
METHODS AND RESULTS: A retrospective cohort study comprising 6 943 263 children (<18 years of age) enrolled in a commercial health insurance plan in the United States, between January 2010 and May 2013. A total of 1583 (0.02\%) children met the criteria for PH. We identified comorbidities significantly associated with PH compared with the general population of children without PH. A Bayesian comorbidity network was constructed to model the interdependencies of these comorbidities, and network-clustering analysis was applied to derive disease subtypes comprising subgraphs of highly connected comorbid conditions. A total of 186 comorbidities were found to be significantly associated with PH. Network analysis of comorbidity patterns captured most of the major PH subtypes with known pathological basis defined by the World Health Organization and Panama classifications. The analysis further identified many subtypes documented in only a few case studies, including rare subtypes associated with several well-described genetic syndromes.
CONCLUSIONS: Application of network science to model comorbidity patterns recorded in longitudinal data sets can facilitate the discovery of disease subtypes. Our analysis relearned established subtypes, thus validating the approach, and identified rare subtypes that are difficult to discern through clinical observations, providing impetus for deeper investigation of the disease subtypes that will enrich current disease classifications.},

The very nature of EMRs does make the application of off-the-shelf machine learning techniques difficult. In this paper, we study two approaches to making predictions that have hardly been compared in the past: (1) extracting high-level (temporal) features from EMRs and building a predictive model, and (2) defining a patient similarity metric and predicting based on the outcome observed for similar patients. We analyze and compare both approaches on the MIMIC-II ICU dataset to predict patient mortality and find that the patient similarity approach does not scale well and results in a less accurate model (AUC of 0.68) compared to the modeling approach (0.84). We also show that mortality can be predicted within a median of 72 hours.},

	abstract = {Objective: Patient notes in electronic health records (EHRs) may contain critical information for medical investigations. However, the vast majority of medical investigators can only access de-identified notes, in order to protect the confidentiality of patients. In the United States, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) defines 18 types of protected health information that needs to be removed to de-identify patient notes. Manual de-identification is impractical given the size of electronic health record databases, the limited number of researchers with access to non-de-identified notes, and the frequent mistakes of human annotators. A reliable automated de-identification system would consequently be of high value.
Materials and Methods: We introduce the first de-identification system based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which requires no handcrafted features or rules, unlike existing systems. We compare the performance of the system with state-of-the-art systems on two datasets: the i2b2 2014 de-identification challenge dataset, which is the largest publicly available de-identification dataset, and the MIMIC de-identification dataset, which we assembled and is twice as large as the i2b2 2014 dataset.
Results: Our ANN model outperforms the state-of-the-art systems. It yields an F1-score of 97.85 on the i2b2 2014 dataset, with a recall of 97.38 and a precision of 98.32, and an F1-score of 99.23 on the MIMIC de-identification dataset, with a recall of 99.25 and a precision of 99.21.
Conclusion: Our findings support the use of ANNs for de-identification of patient notes, as they show better performance than previously published systems while requiring no manual feature engineering.},

The symptoms or characteristics of illness course necessary to develop reliable predictors are not available in coded billing data, but may be present in narrative electronic health record (EHR) discharge summaries. We identified a cohort of individuals admitted to a psychiatric inpatient unit between 1994 and 2012 with a principal diagnosis of major depressive disorder, and extracted inpatient psychiatric discharge narrative notes. Using these data, we trained a 75-topic Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a form of natural language processing, which identifies groups of words associated with topics discussed in a document collection. The cohort was randomly split to derive a training (70\%) and testing (30\%) data set, and we trained separate support vector machine models for baseline clinical features alone, baseline features plus common individual words and the above plus topics identified from the 75-topic LDA model. Of 4687 patients with inpatient discharge summaries, 470 were readmitted within 30 days. The 75-topic LDA model included topics linked to psychiatric symptoms (suicide, severe depression, anxiety, trauma, eating/weight and panic) and major depressive disorder comorbidities (infection, postpartum, brain tumor, diarrhea and pulmonary disease). By including LDA topics, prediction of readmission, as measured by area under receiver-operating characteristic curves in the testing data set, was improved from baseline (area under the curve 0.618) to baseline+1000 words (0.682) to baseline+75 topics (0.784). Inclusion of topics derived from narrative notes allows more accurate discrimination of individuals at high risk for psychiatric readmission in this cohort. Topic modeling and related approaches offer the potential to improve prediction using EHRs, if generalizability can be established in other clinical cohorts.},

	abstract = {Background: The widespread adoption of electronic health records allows us to ask evidence-based questions about the need for and benefits of specific clinical interventions in critical-care settings across large populations.
Objective: We investigated the prediction of vasopressor administration and weaning in the intensive care unit. Vasopressors are commonly used to control hypotension, and changes in timing and dosage can have a large impact on patient outcomes.
Materials and Methods: We considered a cohort of 15 695 intensive care unit patients without orders for reduced care who were alive 30 days post-discharge. A switching-state autoregressive model (SSAM) was trained to predict the multidimensional physiological time series of patients before, during, and after vasopressor administration. The latent states from the SSAM were used as predictors of vasopressor administration and weaning.
Results: The unsupervised SSAM features were able to predict patient vasopressor administration and successful patient weaning. Features derived from the SSAM achieved areas under the receiver operating curve of 0.92, 0.88, and 0.71 for predicting ungapped vasopressor administration, gapped vasopressor administration, and vasopressor weaning, respectively. We also demonstrated many cases where our model predicted weaning well in advance of a successful wean.
Conclusion: Models that used SSAM features increased performance on both predictive tasks. These improvements may reflect an underlying, and ultimately predictive, latent state detectable from the physiological time series.},

	abstract = {Objective: Phenotyping algorithms are capable of accurately identifying patients with specific phenotypes from within electronic medical records systems. However, developing phenotyping algorithms in a scalable way remains a challenge due to the extensive human resources required. This paper introduces a high-throughput unsupervised feature selection method, which improves the robustness and scalability of electronic medical record phenotyping without compromising its accuracy.
Methods: The proposed Surrogate-Assisted Feature Extraction (SAFE) method selects candidate features from a pool of comprehensive medical concepts found in publicly available knowledge sources. The target phenotype's International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and natural language processing counts, acting as noisy surrogates to the gold-standard labels, are used to create silver-standard labels. Candidate features highly predictive of the silver-standard labels are selected as the final features.
Results: Algorithms were trained to identify patients with coronary artery disease, rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, and ulcerative colitis using various numbers of labels to compare the performance of features selected by SAFE, a previously published automated feature extraction for phenotyping procedure, and domain experts. The out-of-sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and F -score from SAFE algorithms were remarkably higher than those from the other two, especially at small label sizes.
Conclusion: SAFE advances high-throughput phenotyping methods by automatically selecting a succinct set of informative features for algorithm training, which in turn reduces overfitting and the needed number of gold-standard labels. SAFE also potentially identifies important features missed by automated feature extraction for phenotyping or experts.},

Using information from the writings of a patient can potentially be a valuable source of information, especially now that more and more treatments involve computer-based exercises or electronic conversations between patient and therapist. In this paper, we study predictive modeling using writings of patients under treatment for a social anxiety disorder. We extract a wealth of information from the text written by patients including their usage of words, the topics they talk about, the sentiment of the messages, and the style of writing. In addition, we study trends over time with respect to those measures. We then apply machine learning algorithms to generate the predictive models. Based on a dataset of 69 patients, we are able to show that we can predict therapy outcome with an area under the curve of 0.83 halfway through the therapy and with a precision of 0.78 when using the full data (i.e., the entire treatment period). Due to the limited number of participants, it is hard to generalize the results, but they do show great potential in this type of information.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: For more than a decade, risk stratification for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been enhanced by targeted genetic testing. Using sequencing results, clinicians routinely assess the risk of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in a patient's relatives and diagnose the condition in patients who have ambiguous clinical presentations. However, the benefits of genetic testing come with the risk that variants may be misclassified.
METHODS: Using publicly accessible exome data, we identified variants that have previously been considered causal in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and that are overrepresented in the general population. We studied these variants in diverse populations and reevaluated their initial ascertainments in the medical literature. We reviewed patient records at a leading genetic-testing laboratory for occurrences of these variants during the near-decade-long history of the laboratory.
RESULTS: Multiple patients, all of whom were of African or unspecified ancestry, received positive reports, with variants misclassified as pathogenic on the basis of the understanding at the time of testing. Subsequently, all reported variants were recategorized as benign. The mutations that were most common in the general population were significantly more common among black Americans than among white Americans (P<0.001). Simulations showed that the inclusion of even small numbers of black Americans in control cohorts probably would have prevented these misclassifications. We identified methodologic shortcomings that contributed to these errors in the medical literature.
CONCLUSIONS: The misclassification of benign variants as pathogenic that we found in our study shows the need for sequencing the genomes of diverse populations, both in asymptomatic controls and the tested patient population. These results expand on current guidelines, which recommend the use of ancestry-matched controls to interpret variants. As additional populations of different ancestry backgrounds are sequenced, we expect variant reclassifications to increase, particularly for ancestry groups that have historically been less well studied.

	abstract = {In natural language processing, stand-off annotation uses the starting and ending positions of an annotation to anchor it to the text and stores the annotation content separately from the text. We address the fundamental problem of efficiently storing stand-off annotations when applying natural language processing on narrative clinical notes in electronic medical records (EMRs) and efficiently retrieving such annotations that satisfy position constraints. Efficient storage and retrieval of stand-off annotations can facilitate tasks such as mapping unstructured text to electronic medical record ontologies. We first formulate this problem into the interval query problem, for which optimal query/update time is in general logarithm. We next perform a tight time complexity analysis on the basic interval tree query algorithm and show its nonoptimality when being applied to a collection of 13 query types from Allen's interval algebra. We then study two closely related state-of-the-art interval query algorithms, proposed query reformulations, and augmentations to the second algorithm. Our proposed algorithm achieves logarithmic time stabbing-max query time complexity and solves the stabbing-interval query tasks on all of Allen's relations in logarithmic time, attaining the theoretic lower bound. Updating time is kept logarithmic and the space requirement is kept linear at the same time. We also discuss interval management in external memory models and higher dimensions. },

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: While clinical laboratories report most test results as individual numbers, findings, or observations, clinical diagnosis usually relies on the results of multiple tests. Clinical decision support that integrates multiple elements of laboratory data could be highly useful in enhancing laboratory diagnosis.
METHODS: Using the analyte ferritin in a proof of concept, we extracted clinical laboratory data from patient testing and applied a variety of machine-learning algorithms to predict ferritin test results using the results from other tests. We compared predicted with measured results and reviewed selected cases to assess the clinical value of predicted ferritin.
RESULTS: We show that patient demographics and results of other laboratory tests can discriminate normal from abnormal ferritin results with a high degree of accuracy (area under the curve as high as 0.97, held-out test data). Case review indicated that predicted ferritin results may sometimes better reflect underlying iron status than measured ferritin.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the substantial informational redundancy present in patient test results and offer a potential foundation for a novel type of clinical decision support aimed at integrating, interpreting, and enhancing the diagnostic value of multianalyte sets of clinical laboratory test results.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Machine learning techniques can be used to extract predictive models for diseases from electronic medical records (EMRs). However, the nature of EMRs makes it difficult to apply off-the-shelf machine learning techniques while still exploiting the rich content of the EMRs. In this paper, we explore the usage of a range of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to extract valuable predictors from uncoded consultation notes and study whether they can help to improve predictive performance.
METHODS: We study a number of existing techniques for the extraction of predictors from the consultation notes, namely a bag of words based approach and topic modeling. In addition, we develop a dedicated technique to match the uncoded consultation notes with a medical ontology. We apply these techniques as an extension to an existing pipeline to extract predictors from EMRs. We evaluate them in the context of predictive modeling for colorectal cancer (CRC), a disease known to be difficult to diagnose before performing an endoscopy.
RESULTS: Our results show that we are able to extract useful information from the consultation notes. The predictive performance of the ontology-based extraction method moves significantly beyond the benchmark of age and gender alone (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.870 versus 0.831). We also observe more accurate predictive models by adding features derived from processing the consultation notes compared to solely using coded data (AUC of 0.896 versus 0.882) although the difference is not significant. The extracted features from the notes are shown be equally predictive (i.e. there is no significant difference in performance) compared to the coded data of the consultations.
CONCLUSION: It is possible to extract useful predictors from uncoded consultation notes that improve predictive performance. Techniques linking text to concepts in medical ontologies to derive these predictors are shown to perform best for predicting CRC in our EMR dataset.},

Tensor factorizations extend the matrix view to multiple modalities and support dimensionality reduction methods that identify latent groups of data for meaningful summarization of both features and instances. In this opinion article, we analyze the modest literature on applying tensor factorization to various biomedical fields including genotyping and phenotyping. Based on the cited work including work of our own, we suggest that tensor applications could serve as an effective tool to enable frequent updating of medical knowledge based on the continually growing scientific and clinical evidence.

The ability to accurately capture both semantic and syntactic structures in text expressing these relations becomes increasingly critical to enable deep understanding of scientific papers and clinical narratives. Shared task challenges have been organized by both bioinformatics and clinical informatics communities to assess and advance the state-of-the-art research. Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction. In particular, graph-based approaches bridge semantics and syntax, often achieving the best performance in shared tasks. However, a number of problems at the frontiers of biomedical relation extraction continue to pose interesting challenges and present opportunities for great improvement and fruitful research.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Typically, algorithms to classify phenotypes using electronic medical record (EMR) data were developed to perform well in a specific patient population. There is increasing interest in analyses which can allow study of a specific outcome across different diseases. Such a study in the EMR would require an algorithm that can be applied across different patient populations. Our objectives were: (1) to develop an algorithm that would enable the study of coronary artery disease (CAD) across diverse patient populations; (2) to study the impact of adding narrative data extracted using natural language processing (NLP) in the algorithm. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement CAD algorithm to compare risk across 3 chronic diseases in a preliminary study.
METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 3 established EMR based patient cohorts: diabetes mellitus (DM, n = 65,099), inflammatory bowel disease (IBD, n = 10,974), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA, n = 4,453) from two large academic centers. We developed a CAD algorithm using NLP in addition to structured data (e.g. ICD9 codes) in the RA cohort and validated it in the DM and IBD cohorts. The CAD algorithm using NLP in addition to structured data achieved specificity >95\% with a positive predictive value (PPV) 90\% in the training (RA) and validation sets (IBD and DM). The addition of NLP data improved the sensitivity for all cohorts, classifying an additional 17\% of CAD subjects in IBD and 10\% in DM while maintaining PPV of 90\%. The algorithm classified 16,488 DM (26.1\%), 457 IBD (4.2\%), and 245 RA (5.0\%) with CAD. In a cross-sectional analysis, CAD risk was 63\% lower in RA and 68\% lower in IBD compared to DM (p<0.0001) after adjusting for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed and validated a CAD algorithm that performed well across diverse patient populations. The addition of NLP into the CAD algorithm improved the sensitivity of the algorithm, particularly in cohorts where the prevalence of CAD was low. Preliminary data suggest that CAD risk was significantly lower in RA and IBD compared to DM.},

	year = {2015},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Analysis of narrative (text) data from electronic health records (EHRs) can improve population-scale phenotyping for clinical and genetic research. Currently, selection of text features for phenotyping algorithms is slow and laborious, requiring extensive and iterative involvement by domain experts. This paper introduces a method to develop phenotyping algorithms in an unbiased manner by automatically extracting and selecting informative features, which can be comparable to expert-curated ones in classification accuracy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Comprehensive medical concepts were collected from publicly available knowledge sources in an automated, unbiased fashion. Natural language processing (NLP) revealed the occurrence patterns of these concepts in EHR narrative notes, which enabled selection of informative features for phenotype classification. When combined with additional codified features, a penalized logistic regression model was trained to classify the target phenotype.
RESULTS: The authors applied our method to develop algorithms to identify patients with rheumatoid arthritis and coronary artery disease cases among those with rheumatoid arthritis from a large multi-institutional EHR. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for classifying RA and CAD using models trained with automated features were 0.951 and 0.929, respectively, compared to the AUCs of 0.938 and 0.929 by models trained with expert-curated features.
DISCUSSION: Models trained with NLP text features selected through an unbiased, automated procedure achieved comparable or slightly higher accuracy than those trained with expert-curated features. The majority of the selected model features were interpretable.
CONCLUSION: The proposed automated feature extraction method, generating highly accurate phenotyping algorithms with improved efficiency, is a significant step toward high-throughput phenotyping.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Extracting medical knowledge from electronic medical records requires automated approaches to combat scalability limitations and selection biases. However, existing machine learning approaches are often regarded by clinicians as black boxes. Moreover, training data for these automated approaches at often sparsely annotated at best. The authors target unsupervised learning for modeling clinical narrative text, aiming at improving both accuracy and interpretability.
METHODS: The authors introduce a novel framework named subgraph augmented non-negative tensor factorization (SANTF). In addition to relying on atomic features (e.g., words in clinical narrative text), SANTF automatically mines higher-order features (e.g., relations of lymphoid cells expressing antigens) from clinical narrative text by converting sentences into a graph representation and identifying important subgraphs. The authors compose a tensor using patients, higher-order features, and atomic features as its respective modes. We then apply non-negative tensor factorization to cluster patients, and simultaneously identify latent groups of higher-order features that link to patient clusters, as in clinical guidelines where a panel of immunophenotypic features and laboratory results are used to specify diagnostic criteria.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: SANTF demonstrated over 10\% improvement in averaged F-measure on patient clustering compared to widely used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and k-means clustering methods. Multiple baselines were established by modeling patient data using patient-by-features matrices with different feature configurations and then performing NMF or k-means to cluster patients. Feature analysis identified latent groups of higher-order features that lead to medical insights. We also found that the latent groups of atomic features help to better correlate the latent groups of higher-order features.},

We evaluate the use of multivariate timeseries modeling with the multi-task Gaussian process (GP) models using noisy, incomplete, sparse, heterogeneous and unevenly-sampled clinical data, including both physiological signals and clinical notes. The learned multi-task GP (MTGP) hyperparameters are then used to assess and forecast patient acuity. Experiments were conducted with two real clinical data sets acquired from ICU patients: firstly, estimating cerebrovascular pressure reactivity, an important indicator of secondary damage for traumatic brain injury patients, by learning the interactions between intracranial pressure and mean arterial blood pressure signals, and secondly, mortality prediction using clinical progress notes. In both cases, MTGPs provided improved results: an MTGP model provided better results than single-task GP models for signal interpolation and forecasting (0.91 vs 0.69 RMSE), and the use of MTGP hyperparameters obtained improved results when used as additional classification features (0.812 vs 0.788 AUC).}}

A multitude of gene prioritization tools have been developed, each integrating different data sources covering gene sequences, differential expressions, function annotations, gene regulations, protein domains, protein interactions, and pathways. This review places existing gene prioritization tools against the backdrop of an integrative Omic hierarchy view toward cancer and focuses on the analysis of their text mining components. We explain the relatively slow progress of text mining in gene prioritization, identify several challenges to current text mining methods, and highlight a few directions where more effective text mining algorithms may improve the overall prioritization task and where prioritizing the pathways may be more desirable than prioritizing only genes. },

	abstract = {Accurate knowledge of a patient's disease state and trajectory is critical in a clinical setting. Modern electronic healthcare records contain an increasingly large amount of data, and the ability to automatically identify the factors that influence patient outcomes stand to greatly improve the efficiency and quality of care. We examined the use of latent variable models (viz. Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to decompose free-text hospital notes into meaningful features, and the predictive power of these features for patient mortality. We considered three prediction regimes: (1) baseline prediction, (2) dynamic (time-varying) outcome prediction, and (3) retrospective outcome prediction. In each, our prediction task differs from the familiar time-varying situation whereby data accumulates; since fewer patients have long ICU stays, as we move forward in time fewer patients are available and the prediction task becomes increasingly difficult. We found that latent topic-derived features were effective in determining patient mortality under three timelines: inhospital, 30 day post-discharge, and 1 year post-discharge mortality. Our results demonstrated that the latent topic features important in predicting hospital mortality are very different from those that are important in post-discharge mortality. In general, latent topic features were more predictive than structured features, and a combination of the two performed best. The time-varying models that combined latent topic features and baseline features had AUCs that reached 0.85, 0.80, and 0.77 for in-hospital, 30 day post-discharge and 1 year post-discharge mortality respectively. Our results agreed with other work suggesting that the first 24 hours of patient information are often the most predictive of hospital mortality. Retrospective models that used a combination of latent topic features and structured features achieved AUCs of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.81 for in-hospital, 30 day, and 1-year mortality prediction. Our work focuses on the dynamic (time-varying) setting because models from this regime could facilitate an on-going severity stratification system that helps direct care-staff resources and inform treatment strategies.},

	abstract = {To reduce costs and improve clinical relevance of genetic studies, there has been increasing interest in performing such studies in hospital-based cohorts by linking phenotypes extracted from electronic medical records (EMRs) to genotypes assessed in routinely collected medical samples. A fundamental difficulty in implementing such studies is extracting accurate information about disease outcomes and important clinical covariates from large numbers of EMRs. Recently, numerous algorithms have been developed to infer phenotypes by combining information from multiple structured and unstructured variables extracted from EMRs. Although these algorithms are quite accurate, they typically do not provide perfect classification due to the difficulty in inferring meaning from the text. Some algorithms can produce for each patient a probability that the patient is a disease case. This probability can be thresholded to define case-control status, and this estimated case-control status has been used to replicate known genetic associations in EMR-based studies. However, using the estimated disease status in place of true disease status results in outcome misclassification, which can diminish test power and bias odds ratio estimates. We propose to instead directly model the algorithm-derived probability of being a case. We demonstrate how our approach improves test power and effect estimation in simulation studies, and we describe its performance in a study of rheumatoid arthritis. Our work provides an easily implemented solution to a major practical challenge that arises in the use of EMR data, which can facilitate the use of EMR infrastructure for more powerful, cost-effective, and diverse genetic studies. },

	abstract = {The aim of our study is to determine the short-term and long-term outcomes of intensive care unit (ICU) patients with minor troponin elevations. The retrospective study compared ICU patients with peak troponin elevation less than 0.1 ng/ml to those with only negative tests during their hospital stay. Data were gathered from ICUs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2008. A total of 4224 patients (2547 controls and 1677 positives) were analysed. The primary outcome was mortality at one year. Secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality and hospital and ICU lengths of stay. After adjusting for age, sex, Simplified Acute Physiology Score, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment and combined Elixhauser score, we found that minor troponin elevations (peak troponin elevation between 0.01 and 0.09 ng/ml) were associated with a higher one-year mortality (Hazard Ratio 1.22, P <0.001 for binary troponin presence; Hazard Ratio 1.03, P <0.001 for each 0.01 ng/ml troponin increment). This relationship held for the subgroup of seven-day post-discharge survivors (Hazard Ratio 1.26, P <0.001). Minor elevations of troponin also significantly increased the net reclassification index over traditional risk markers for mortality prediction (net reclassification score 0.12, P <0.001). Minor troponin elevation was also associated with 30-day mortality (odds ratio 1.33, P=0.003). Importantly, troponin testing did not increase the adjusted mortality odds (P=0.9). Minor elevations in troponin substantially increase one-year, all-cause mortality in a stepwise fashion; it was also independently associated with 30-day mortality. We propose that minor elevations in troponin should not be regarded as clinically unimportant, but rather be included as a prognostic element if measured. We recommend prospective ICU studies to assess prognostic value of routine troponin determination. },

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is tremendous potential for genome sequencing to improve clinical diagnosis and care once it becomes routinely accessible, but this will require formalizing research methods into clinical best practices in the areas of sequence data generation, analysis, interpretation and reporting. The CLARITY Challenge was designed to spur convergence in methods for diagnosing genetic disease starting from clinical case history and genome sequencing data. DNA samples were obtained from three families with heritable genetic disorders and genomic sequence data were donated by sequencing platform vendors. The challenge was to analyze and interpret these data with the goals of identifying disease-causing variants and reporting the findings in a clinically useful format. Participating contestant groups were solicited broadly, and an independent panel of judges evaluated their performance.
RESULTS: A total of 30 international groups were engaged. The entries reveal a general convergence of practices on most elements of the analysis and interpretation process. However, even given this commonality of approach, only two groups identified the consensus candidate variants in all disease cases, demonstrating a need for consistent fine-tuning of the generally accepted methods. There was greater diversity of the final clinical report content and in the patient consenting process, demonstrating that these areas require additional exploration and standardization.
CONCLUSIONS: The CLARITY Challenge provides a comprehensive assessment of current practices for using genome sequencing to diagnose and report genetic diseases. There is remarkable convergence in bioinformatic techniques, but medical interpretation and reporting are areas that require further development by many groups.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have an increased risk of clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Cathelicidins are anti-microbial peptides that attenuate colitis and inhibit the effect of clostridial toxins. Plasma calcifediol [25(OH)D] stimulates production of cathelicidins.
AIM: To examine the association between plasma 25(OH)D and CDI in patients with IBD.
METHODS: From a multi-institutional IBD cohort, we identified patients with at least one measured plasma 25(OH)D. Our primary outcome was development of CDI. Multivariate logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders were used to identify independent effect of plasma 25(OH)D on risk of CDI.
RESULTS: We studied 3188 IBD patients of whom 35 patients developed CDI. Patients with CDI-IBD were older and had greater co-morbidity. The mean plasma 25(OH)D level was significantly lower in patients who developed CDI (20.4 ng/mL) compared to non-CDI-IBD patients (27.1 ng/mL) (P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, each 1 ng/mL increase in plasma 25(OH)D was associated with a 4\% reduction in risk of CDI (OR 0.96, 95\% CI 0.93-0.99, P = 0.046). Compared to individuals with vitamin D >20 ng/mL, patients with levels <20 ng/mL were more likely to develop CDI (OR 2.27, 95\% CI 1.16-4.44). The mean plasma 25(OH)D in patients with CDI who subsequently died was significantly lower (12.8 $\pm$ 8.1 ng/mL) compared to those who were alive at the end of follow-up (24.3 $\pm$ 13.2 ng/mL) (P = 0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Higher plasma calcifediol [25(OH)D] is associated with reduced risk of C. difficile infection in patients with IBD. Further studies of therapeutic supplementation of vitamin D in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and C. difficile infection may be warranted.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) have increased risk for venous thromboembolism (VTE); those who require hospitalization have particularly high risk. Few hospitalized patients with IBD receive thromboprophylaxis. We analyzed the frequency of VTE after IBD-related hospitalization, risk factors for post-hospitalization VTE, and the efficacy of prophylaxis in preventing post-hospitalization VTE.
METHODS: In a retrospective study, we analyzed data from a multi-institutional cohort of patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis and at least 1 IBD-related hospitalization. Our primary outcome was a VTE event. All patients contributed person-time from the date of the index hospitalization to development of VTE, subsequent hospitalization, or end of follow-up. Our main predictor variable was pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis. Cox proportional hazard models adjusting for potential confounders were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs).
RESULTS: From a cohort of 2788 patients with at least 1 IBD-related hospitalization, 62 patients developed VTE after discharge (2\%). Incidences of VTE at 30, 60, 90, and 180 days after the index hospitalization were 3.7/1000, 4.1/1000, 5.4/1000, and 9.4/1000 person-days, respectively. Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis during the index hospital stay was associated with a significantly lower risk of post-hospitalization VTE (HR, 0.46; 95\% CI, 0.22-0.97). Increased numbers of comorbidities (HR, 1.30; 95\% CI, 1.16-1.47) and need for corticosteroids before hospitalization (HR, 1.71; 95\% CI, 1.02-2.87) were also independently associated with risk of VTE. Length of hospitalization or surgery during index hospitalization was not associated with post-hospitalization VTE.
CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis during IBD-related hospitalization is associated with reduced risk of post-hospitalization VTE.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) frequently co-occur. PSC is associated with increased risk for colorectal cancer (CRC). However, whether PSC is associated with increased risk of extraintestinal cancers or affects mortality in an IBD cohort has not been examined previously.
METHODS: In a multi-institutional IBD cohort of IBD, we established a diagnosis of PSC using a novel algorithm incorporating narrative and codified data with high positive and negative predictive value. Our primary outcome was occurrence of extraintestinal and digestive tract cancers. Mortality was determined through monthly linkage to the social security master death index.
RESULTS: In our cohort of 5506 patients with CD and 5522 patients with UC, a diagnosis of PSC was established in 224 patients (2\%). Patients with IBD-PSC were younger and more likely to be male compared to IBD patients without PSC; three-quarters had UC. IBD-PSC patients had significantly increased overall risk of cancers compared to patients without PSC (OR 4.36, 95\% CI 2.99-6.37). Analysis of specific cancer types revealed that a statistically significant excess risk for digestive tract cancer (OR 10.40, 95\% CI 6.86-15.76), pancreatic cancer (OR 11.22, 95\% CI 4.11-30.62), colorectal cancer (OR 5.00, 95\% CI 2.80-8.95), and cholangiocarcinoma (OR 55.31, 95\% CI 22.20-137.80) but not for other solid organ or hematologic malignancies.
CONCLUSIONS: PSC is associated with increased risk of colorectal and pancreatobiliary cancer but not with excess risk of other solid organ cancers.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on the word sense disambiguation (WSD) task in the clinical domain. In particular, to compare graph-based approaches relying on a clinical knowledge base with bottom-up topic-modeling-based approaches. We investigate several enhancements to the topic-modeling techniques that use domain-specific knowledge sources.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The graph-based methods use variations of PageRank and distance-based similarity metrics, operating over the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). Topic-modeling methods use unlabeled data from the Multiparameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC II) database to derive models for each ambiguous word. We investigate the impact of using different linguistic features for topic models, including UMLS-based and syntactic features. We use a sense-tagged clinical dataset from the Mayo Clinic for evaluation.
RESULTS: The topic-modeling methods achieve 66.9\% accuracy on a subset of the Mayo Clinic's data, while the graph-based methods only reach the 40-50\% range, with a most-frequent-sense baseline of 56.5\%. Features derived from the UMLS semantic type and concept hierarchies do not produce a gain over bag-of-words features in the topic models, but identifying phrases from UMLS and using syntax does help.
DISCUSSION: Although topic models outperform graph-based methods, semantic features derived from the UMLS prove too noisy to improve performance beyond bag-of-words.
CONCLUSIONS: Topic modeling for WSD provides superior results in the clinical domain; however, integration of knowledge remains to be effectively exploited.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pathology reports are rich in narrative statements that encode a complex web of relations among medical concepts. These relations are routinely used by doctors to reason on diagnoses, but often require hand-crafted rules or supervised learning to extract into prespecified forms for computational disease modeling. We aim to automatically capture relations from narrative text without supervision.
METHODS: We design a novel framework that translates sentences into graph representations, automatically mines sentence subgraphs, reduces redundancy in mined subgraphs, and automatically generates subgraph features for subsequent classification tasks. To ensure meaningful interpretations over the sentence graphs, we use the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus to map token subsequences to concepts, and in turn sentence graph nodes. We test our system with multiple lymphoma classification tasks that together mimic the differential diagnosis by a pathologist. To this end, we prevent our classifiers from looking at explicit mentions or synonyms of lymphomas in the text.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We compare our system with three baseline classifiers using standard n-grams, full MetaMap concepts, and filtered MetaMap concepts. Our system achieves high F-measures on multiple binary classifications of lymphoma (Burkitt lymphoma, 0.8; diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 0.909; follicular lymphoma, 0.84; Hodgkin lymphoma, 0.912). Significance tests show that our system outperforms all three baselines. Moreover, feature analysis identifies subgraph features that contribute to improved performance; these features agree with the state-of-the-art knowledge about lymphoma classification. We also highlight how these unsupervised relation features may provide meaningful insights into lymphoma classification.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis) are at increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). Persistent inflammation is hypothesized to increase risk of CRC in patients with IBD; however, the few studies in this area have been restricted to cross-sectional assessments of histologic severity. No prior studies have examined association between C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) elevation and risk of CRC in an IBD cohort.
METHODS: From a multi-institutional validated IBD cohort, we identified all patients with at least one measured CRP or ESR value. Patients were stratified into quartiles of severity of inflammation on the basis of their median CRP or ESR value, and subsequent diagnosis of CRC was ascertained. Logistic regression adjusting for potential confounders was used to identify the independent association between CRP or ESR elevation and risk of CRC.
RESULTS: Our study included 3145 patients with at least 1 CRP value (CRP cohort) and 4008 with at least 1 ESR value (ESR cohort). Thirty-three patients in the CRP cohort and 102 patients in the ESR cohort developed CRC during a median follow-up of 5 years at a median age of 55 years. On multivariate analysis, there was a significant increase in risk of CRC across quartiles of CRP elevation (P(trend) = .017; odds ratio for quartile 4 vs quartile 1, 2.72; 95\% confidence interval, 0.95-7.76). Similarly higher median ESR was also independently associated with risk of CRC across the quartiles (odds ratio, 2.06; 95\% confidence interval, 1.14-3.74) (P(trend) = .007).
CONCLUSIONS: An elevated CRP or ESR is associated with increased risk of CRC in patients with IBD.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Reducing care variability through guidelines has significantly benefited patients. Nonetheless, guideline-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems are not widely implemented or used, are frequently out-of-date, and cannot address complex care for which guidelines do not exist. Here, we develop and evaluate a complementary approach - using Bayesian Network (BN) learning to generate adaptive, context-specific treatment menus based on local order-entry data. These menus can be used as a draft for expert review, in order to minimize development time for local decision support content. This is in keeping with the vision outlined in the US Health Information Technology Strategic Plan, which describes a healthcare system that learns from itself.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Greedy Equivalence Search algorithm to learn four 50-node domain-specific BNs from 11,344 encounters: abdominal pain in the emergency department, inpatient pregnancy, hypertension in the Urgent Visit Clinic, and altered mental state in the intensive care unit. We developed a system to produce situation-specific, rank-ordered treatment menus from these networks. We evaluated this system with a hospital-simulation methodology and computed Area Under the Receiver-Operator Curve (AUC) and average menu position at time of selection. We also compared this system with a similar association-rule-mining approach.
RESULTS: A short order menu on average contained the next order (weighted average length 3.91-5.83 items). Overall predictive ability was good: average AUC above 0.9 for 25\% of order types and overall average AUC .714-.844 (depending on domain). However, AUC had high variance (.50-.99). Higher AUC correlated with tighter clusters and more connections in the graphs, indicating importance of appropriate contextual data. Comparison with an Association Rule Mining approach showed similar performance for only the most common orders with dramatic divergence as orders are less frequent.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that local clinical knowledge can be extracted from treatment data for decision support. This approach is appealing because: it reflects local standards; it uses data already being captured; and it produces human-readable treatment-diagnosis networks that could be curated by a human expert to reduce workload in developing localized CDS content. The BN methodology captured transitive associations and co-varying relationships, which existing approaches do not. It also performs better as orders become less frequent and require more context. This system is a step forward in harnessing local, empirical data to enhance decision support.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To optimally leverage the scalability and unique features of the electronic health records (EHR) for research that would ultimately improve patient care, we need to accurately identify patients and extract clinically meaningful measures. Using multiple sclerosis (MS) as a proof of principle, we showcased how to leverage routinely collected EHR data to identify patients with a complex neurological disorder and derive an important surrogate measure of disease severity heretofore only available in research settings.
METHODS: In a cross-sectional observational study, 5,495 MS patients were identified from the EHR systems of two major referral hospitals using an algorithm that includes codified and narrative information extracted using natural language processing. In the subset of patients who receive neurological care at a MS Center where disease measures have been collected, we used routinely collected EHR data to extract two aggregate indicators of MS severity of clinical relevance multiple sclerosis severity score (MSSS) and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF, a measure of whole brain volume).
RESULTS: The EHR algorithm that identifies MS patients has an area under the curve of 0.958, 83\% sensitivity, 92\% positive predictive value, and 89\% negative predictive value when a 95\% specificity threshold is used. The correlation between EHR-derived and true MSSS has a mean R(2) = 0.38$\pm$0.05, and that between EHR-derived and true BPF has a mean R(2) = 0.22$\pm$0.08. To illustrate its clinical relevance, derived MSSS captures the expected difference in disease severity between relapsing-remitting and progressive MS patients after adjusting for sex, age of symptom onset and disease duration (p = 1.56×10(-12)).
CONCLUSION: Incorporation of sophisticated codified and narrative EHR data accurately identifies MS patients and provides estimation of a well-accepted indicator of MS severity that is widely used in research settings but not part of the routine medical records. Similar approaches could be applied to other complex neurological disorders.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Vitamin D deficiency is common among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) (Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis). The effects of low plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25[OH]D) on outcomes other than bone health are understudied in patients with IBD. We examined the association between plasma level of 25(OH)D and risk of cancers in patients with IBD.
METHODS: From a multi-institutional cohort of patients with IBD, we identified those with at least 1 measurement of plasma 25(OH)D. The primary outcome was development of any cancer. We examined the association between plasma 25(OH)D and risk of specific subtypes of cancer, adjusting for potential confounders in a multivariate regression model.
RESULTS: We analyzed data from 2809 patients with IBD and a median plasma level of 25(OH)D of 26 ng/mL. Nearly one-third had deficient levels of vitamin D (<20 ng/mL). During a median follow-up period of 11 years, 196 patients (7\%) developed cancer, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer (41 cases of colorectal cancer). Patients with vitamin D deficiency had an increased risk of cancer (adjusted odds ratio, 1.82; 95\% confidence interval, 1.25-2.65) compared with those with sufficient levels. Each 1-ng/mL increase in plasma 25(OH)D was associated with an 8\% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer (odds ratio, 0.92; 95\% confidence interval, 0.88-0.96). A weaker inverse association was also identified for lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: In a large multi-institutional IBD cohort, a low plasma level of 25(OH)D was associated with an increased risk of cancer, especially colorectal cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vitamin D may have an immunologic role in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Retrospective studies suggested a weak association between vitamin D status and disease activity but have significant limitations.
METHODS: Using a multi-institution inflammatory bowel disease cohort, we identified all patients with CD and UC who had at least one measured plasma 25-hydroxy vitamin D (25(OH)D). Plasma 25(OH)D was considered sufficient at levels ≥30 ng/mL. Logistic regression models adjusting for potential confounders were used to identify impact of measured plasma 25(OH)D on subsequent risk of inflammatory bowel disease-related surgery or hospitalization. In a subset of patients where multiple measures of 25(OH)D were available, we examined impact of normalization of vitamin D status on study outcomes.
RESULTS: Our study included 3217 patients (55\% CD; mean age, 49 yr). The median lowest plasma 25(OH)D was 26 ng/mL (interquartile range, 17-35 ng/mL). In CD, on multivariable analysis, plasma 25(OH)D <20 ng/mL was associated with an increased risk of surgery (odds ratio, 1.76; 95\% confidence interval, 1.24-2.51) and inflammatory bowel disease-related hospitalization (odds ratio, 2.07; 95\% confidence interval, 1.59-2.68) compared with those with 25(OH)D ≥30 ng/mL. Similar estimates were also seen for UC. Furthermore, patients with CD who had initial levels <30 ng/mL but subsequently normalized their 25(OH)D had a reduced likelihood of surgery (odds ratio, 0.56; 95\% confidence interval, 0.32-0.98) compared with those who remained deficient.
CONCLUSION: Low plasma 25(OH)D is associated with increased risk of surgery and hospitalizations in both CD and UC, and normalization of 25(OH)D status is associated with a reduction in the risk of CD-related surgery.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: While genetic determinants of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels are well characterised in the general population, they are understudied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Our objective was to determine the association of established LDL and RA genetic alleles with LDL levels in RA cases compared with non-RA controls.
METHODS: Using data from electronic medical records, we linked validated RA cases and non-RA controls to discarded blood samples. For each individual, we extracted data on: first LDL measurement, age, gender and year of LDL measurement. We genotyped subjects for 11 LDL and 44 non-HLA RA alleles, and calculated RA and LDL genetic risk scores (GRS). We tested the association between each GRS and LDL level using multivariate linear regression models adjusted for age, gender, year of LDL measurement and RA status.
RESULTS: Among 567 RA cases and 979 controls, 80\% were female and mean age at the first LDL measurement was 55 years. RA cases had significantly lower mean LDL levels than controls (117.2 vs 125.6 mg/dl, respectively, p<0.0001). Each unit increase in LDL GRS was associated with 0.8 mg/dl higher LDL levels in both RA cases and controls (p=3.0×10(-7)). Each unit increase in RA GRS was associated with 4.3 mg/dl lower LDL levels in both groups (p=0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: LDL alleles were associated with higher LDL levels in RA. RA alleles were associated with lower LDL levels in both RA cases and controls. As RA cases carry more RA alleles, these findings suggest a genetic basis for epidemiological observations of lower LDL levels in RA.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies identifying patients with inflammatory bowel disease using administrative codes have yielded inconsistent results. Our objective was to develop a robust electronic medical record-based model for classification of inflammatory bowel disease leveraging the combination of codified data and information from clinical text notes using natural language processing.
METHODS: Using the electronic medical records of 2 large academic centers, we created data marts for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) comprising patients with ≥1 International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition, code for each disease. We used codified (i.e., International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes, electronic prescriptions) and narrative data from clinical notes to develop our classification model. Model development and validation was performed in a training set of 600 randomly selected patients for each disease with medical record review as the gold standard. Logistic regression with the adaptive LASSO penalty was used to select informative variables.
RESULTS: We confirmed 399 CD cases (67\%) in the CD training set and 378 UC cases (63\%) in the UC training set. For both, a combined model including narrative and codified data had better accuracy (area under the curve for CD 0.95; UC 0.94) than models using only disease International Classification of Diseases, 9th edition codes (area under the curve 0.89 for CD; 0.86 for UC). Addition of natural language processing narrative terms to our final model resulted in classification of 6\% to 12\% more subjects with the same accuracy.
CONCLUSIONS: Inclusion of narrative concepts identified using natural language processing improves the accuracy of electronic medical records case definition for CD and UC while simultaneously identifying more subjects compared with models using codified data alone.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Psychiatric comorbidity is common in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-related surgery or hospitalizations represent major events in the natural history of the disease. The objective of this study is to examine whether there is a difference in the risk of psychiatric comorbidity following surgery in CD and UC.
METHODS: We used a multi-institution cohort of IBD patients without a diagnosis code for anxiety or depression preceding their IBD-related surgery or hospitalization. Demographic-, disease-, and treatment-related variables were retrieved. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to individually identify risk factors for depression and anxiety.
RESULTS: Our study included a total of 707 CD and 530 UC patients who underwent bowel resection surgery and did not have depression before surgery. The risk of depression 5 years after surgery was 16\% and 11\% in CD and UC patients, respectively. We found no difference in the risk of depression following surgery in the CD and UC patients (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95\% confidence interval, 0.84-1.47). Female gender, comorbidity, immunosuppressant use, perianal disease, stoma surgery, and early surgery within 3 years of care predicted depression after CD surgery; only the female gender and comorbidity predicted depression in UC patients. Only 12\% of the CD cohort had ≥4 risk factors for depression, but among them nearly 44\% subsequently received a diagnosis code for depression.
CONCLUSIONS: IBD-related surgery or hospitalization is associated with a significant risk for depression and anxiety, with a similar magnitude of risk in both diseases.},

This work describes a new unsupervised learning approach, radial domain folding, to scale and summarize the enormous amount of data collected and to visualize the degradations or improvements in multiple organ systems in real time. Our proposed system is based on learning multi-layer lower dimensional abstractions from routinely generated patient data in modern Intensive Care Units (ICUs), and is dramatically different from most of the current work being done in ICU data mining that rely on building supervised predictive models using commonly measured clinical observations. We demonstrate that our system discovers abstract patient states that summarize a patient's physiology. Further, we show that a logistic regression model trained exclusively on our learned layer outperforms a customized SAPS II score on the mortality prediction task.}}

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Psychiatric co-morbidity, in particular major depression and anxiety, is common in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Prior studies examining this may be confounded by the co-existence of functional bowel symptoms. Limited data exist examining an association between depression or anxiety and disease-specific endpoints such as bowel surgery.
AIMS: To examine the frequency of depression and anxiety (prior to surgery or hospitalisation) in a large multi-institution electronic medical record (EMR)-based cohort of CD and UC patients; to define the independent effect of psychiatric co-morbidity on risk of subsequent surgery or hospitalisation in CD and UC, and to identify the effects of depression and anxiety on healthcare utilisation in our cohort.
METHODS: Using a multi-institution cohort of patients with CD and UC, we identified those who also had co-existing psychiatric co-morbidity (major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety). After excluding those diagnosed with such co-morbidity for the first time following surgery, we used multivariate logistic regression to examine the independent effect of psychiatric co-morbidity on IBD-related surgery and hospitalisation. To account for confounding by disease severity, we adjusted for a propensity score estimating likelihood of psychiatric co-morbidity influenced by severity of disease in our models.
RESULTS: A total of 5405 CD and 5429 UC patients were included in this study; one-fifth had either major depressive disorder or generalised anxiety. In multivariate analysis, adjusting for potential confounders and the propensity score, presence of mood or anxiety co-morbidity was associated with a 28\% increase in risk of surgery in CD (OR: 1.28, 95\% CI: 1.03-1.57), but not UC (OR: 1.01, 95\% CI: 0.80-1.28). Psychiatric co-morbidity was associated with increased healthcare utilisation.
CONCLUSIONS: Depressive disorder or generalised anxiety is associated with a modestly increased risk of surgery in patients with Crohn's disease. Interventions addressing this may improve patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The significance of non-rheumatoid arthritis (RA) autoantibodies in patients with RA is unclear. The aim of this study was to assess associations of autoantibodies with autoimmune risk alleles and with clinical diagnoses from the electronic medical records (EMRs) among RA cases and non-RA controls.
METHODS: Data on 1,290 RA cases and 1,236 non-RA controls of European genetic ancestry were obtained from the EMRs of 2 large academic centers. The levels of anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies (AGTAs), and anti-thyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies were measured. All subjects were genotyped for autoimmune risk alleles, and the association between number of autoimmune risk alleles present and number of types of autoantibodies present was studied. A phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) was conducted to study potential associations between autoantibodies and clinical diagnoses among RA cases and non-RA controls.
RESULTS: The mean ages were 60.7 years in RA cases and 64.6 years in non-RA controls. The proportion of female subjects was 79\% in each group. The prevalence of ACPAs and ANAs was higher in RA cases compared to controls (each P < 0.0001); there were no differences in the prevalence of anti-TPO antibodies and AGTAs. Carriage of higher numbers of autoimmune risk alleles was associated with increasing numbers of autoantibody types in RA cases (P = 2.1 × 10(-5)) and non-RA controls (P = 5.0 × 10(-3)). From the PheWAS, the presence of ANAs was significantly associated with a diagnosis of Sjögren's/sicca syndrome in RA cases.
CONCLUSION: The increased frequency of autoantibodies in RA cases and non-RA controls was associated with the number of autoimmune risk alleles carried by an individual. PheWAS of EMR data, with linkage to laboratory data obtained from blood samples, provide a novel method to test for the clinical significance of biomarkers in disease.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Narratives of electronic medical records contain information that can be useful for clinical practice and multi-purpose research. This information needs to be put into a structured form before it can be used by automated systems. Coreference resolution is a step in the transformation of narratives into a structured form.
METHODS: This study presents a medical coreference resolution system (MCORES) for noun phrases in four frequently used clinical semantic categories: persons, problems, treatments, and tests. MCORES treats coreference resolution as a binary classification task. Given a pair of concepts from a semantic category, it determines coreferent pairs and clusters them into chains. MCORES uses an enhanced set of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features. Some MCORES features measure the distance between various representations of the concepts in a pair and can be asymmetric.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: MCORES was compared with an in-house baseline that uses only single-perspective 'token overlap' and 'number agreement' features. MCORES was shown to outperform the baseline; its enhanced features contribute significantly to performance. In addition to the baseline, MCORES was compared against two available third-party, open-domain systems, RECONCILE(ACL09) and the Beautiful Anaphora Resolution Toolkit (BART). MCORES was shown to outperform both of these systems on clinical records.},

However, under pressure to form accountable care organizations, medical groups may merge and support private health information exchanges. Such activity could reduce the potential utility of community exchanges-that is, the exchanges' capacity to share patient data across hospitals and physician practices that are independent. Simulations of care transitions based on data from ten Massachusetts communities suggest that there would have to be many such mergers to undermine the potential utility of health information exchanges. At the same time, because hospitals and the largest medical groups account for only 10-20 percent of care transitions in a community, information exchanges will still need to recruit a large proportion of the medical groups in a given community for the exchanges to maintain their usefulness in fostering information exchange across independent providers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The electronic exchange of health information among healthcare providers has the potential to produce enormous clinical benefits and financial savings, although realizing that potential will be challenging. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will reward providers for 'meaningful use' of electronic health records, including participation in clinical data exchange, but the best ways to do so remain uncertain.
METHODS: We analyzed patient visits in one community in which a high proportion of providers were using an electronic health record and participating in data exchange. Using claims data from one large private payer for individuals under age 65 years, we computed the number of visits to a provider which involved transitions in care from other providers as a percentage of total visits. We calculated this 'transition percentage' for individual providers and medical groups.
RESULTS: On average, excluding radiology and pathology, approximately 51\% of visits involved care transitions between individual providers in the community and 36\%-41\% involved transitions between medical groups. There was substantial variation in transition percentage across medical specialties, within specialties and across medical groups. Specialists tended to have higher transition percentages and smaller ranges within specialty than primary care physicians, who ranged from 32\% to 95\% (including transitions involving radiology and pathology). The transition percentages of pediatric practices were similar to those of adult primary care, except that many transitions occurred among pediatric physicians within a single medical group.
CONCLUSIONS: Care transition patterns differed substantially by type of practice and should be considered in designing incentives to foster providers' meaningful use of health data exchange services.},

	abstract = {Discovering and following up on genetic associations with complex phenotypes require large patient cohorts. This is particularly true for patient cohorts of diverse ancestry and clinically relevant subsets of disease. The ability to mine the electronic health records (EHRs) of patients followed as part of routine clinical care provides a potential opportunity to efficiently identify affected cases and unaffected controls for appropriate-sized genetic studies. Here, we demonstrate proof-of-concept that it is possible to use EHR data linked with biospecimens to establish a multi-ethnic case-control cohort for genetic research of a complex disease, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). In 1,515 EHR-derived RA cases and 1,480 controls matched for both genetic ancestry and disease-specific autoantibodies (anti-citrullinated protein antibodies [ACPA]), we demonstrate that the odds ratios and aggregate genetic risk score (GRS) of known RA risk alleles measured in individuals of European ancestry within our EHR cohort are nearly identical to those derived from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 5,539 autoantibody-positive RA cases and 20,169 controls. We extend this approach to other ethnic groups and identify a large overlap in the GRS among individuals of European, African, East Asian, and Hispanic ancestry. We also demonstrate that the distribution of a GRS based on 28 non-HLA risk alleles in ACPA+ cases partially overlaps with ACPA- subgroup of RA cases. Our study demonstrates that the genetic basis of rheumatoid arthritis risk is similar among cases of diverse ancestry divided into subsets based on ACPA status and emphasizes the utility of linking EHR clinical data with biospecimens for genetic studies.},

We assessed whether a classification algorithm incorporating narrative EMR data (typed physician notes) more accurately classifies subjects with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) compared with an algorithm using codified EMR data alone.
METHODS: Subjects with > or =1 International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision RA code (714.xx) or who had anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) checked in the EMR of 2 large academic centers were included in an ``RA Mart'' (n = 29,432). For all 29,432 subjects, we extracted narrative (using natural language processing) and codified RA clinical information. In a training set of 96 RA and 404 non-RA cases from the RA Mart classified by medical record review, we used narrative and codified data to develop classification algorithms using logistic regression. These algorithms were applied to the entire RA Mart. We calculated and compared the positive predictive value (PPV) of these algorithms by reviewing the records of an additional 400 subjects classified as having RA by the algorithms.
RESULTS: A complete algorithm (narrative and codified data) classified RA subjects with a significantly higher PPV of 94\% than an algorithm with codified data alone (PPV of 88\%). Characteristics of the RA cohort identified by the complete algorithm were comparable to existing RA cohorts (80\% women, 63\% anti-CCP positive, and 59\% positive for erosions).
CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the ability to utilize complete EMR data to define an RA cohort with a PPV of 94\%, which was superior to an algorithm using codified data alone.},

We explore the intriguing possibility that technology can help accurately capture structured data from the clinical encounter using a combination of automated speech recognition (ASR) systems and tools for extraction of clinical meaning from narrative medical text. Our goal is to produce a displayed evolving encounter note, visible and editable (using speech) during the encounter.
RESULTS: This is very ambitious, and so far we have taken only the most preliminary steps. We report a simple proof-of-concept system and the design of the more comprehensive one we are building, discussing both the engineering design and challenges encountered. Without a formal evaluation, we were encouraged by our initial results. The proof-of-concept, despite a few false positives, correctly recognized the proper category of single-and multi-word phrases in uncorrected ASR output. The more comprehensive system captures and transcribes speech and stores alternative phrase interpretations in an XML-based format used by a text-engineering framework. It does not yet use the framework to perform the language processing present in the proof-of-concept.
CONCLUSION: The work here encouraged us that the goal is reachable, so we conclude with proposed next steps.Some challenging steps include acquiring a corpus of doctor-patient conversations, exploring a workable microphone setup, performing user interface research, and developing a multi-speaker version of our tools.},

DESIGN/METHODS: This study used retrospective analysis of mixed medical/surgical intensive care patients in a university hospital. Logistic regression was applied to 7048 development patients with several hundred candidate variables. Final models were selected by backward elimination on top cross-validated variables and validated on 3018 separate patients.
RESULTS: The real-time model demonstrated strong discrimination ability (Day 3 AUC=0.878). All models had circumstances where calibration was poor (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test p < 0.1). The final models included variables known to be associated with mortality, but also more computationally intensive variables absent in other severity scores.
CONCLUSION: Real-time mortality prediction offers similar discrimination ability to daily models. Moreover, the discrimination of our real-time model performed favorably to a customized SAPS II (Day 3 AUC=0.878 vs AUC=0.849, p < 0.05) but generally had worse calibration.}}

	volume = {12},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The goal of personalised medicine in the intensive care unit (ICU) is to predict which diagnostic tests, monitoring interventions and treatments translate to improved outcomes given the variation between patients. Unfortunately, processes such as gene transcription and drug metabolism are dynamic in the critically ill; that is, information obtained during static non-diseased conditions may have limited applicability. We propose an alternative way of personalising medicine in the ICU on a real-time basis using information derived from the application of artificial intelligence on a high-resolution database. Calculation of maintenance fluid requirement at the height of systemic inflammatory response was selected to investigate the feasibility of this approach.
METHODS: The Multi-parameter Intelligent Monitoring for Intensive Care II (MIMIC II) is a database of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center ICU in Boston. Patients who were on vasopressors for more than six hours during the first 24 hours of admission were identified from the database. Demographic and physiological variables that might affect fluid requirement or reflect the intravascular volume during the first 24 hours in the ICU were extracted from the database. The outcome to be predicted is the total amount of fluid given during the second 24 hours in the ICU, including all the fluid boluses administered.
RESULTS: We represented the variables by learning a Bayesian network from the underlying data. Using 10-fold cross-validation repeated 100 times, the accuracy of the model in predicting the outcome is 77.8\%. The network generated has a threshold Bayes factor of seven representing the posterior probability of the model given the observed data. This Bayes factor translates into p < 0.05 assuming a Gaussian distribution of the variables.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the model, the probability that a patient would require a certain range of fluid on day two can be predicted. In the presence of a larger database, analysis may be limited to patients with identical clinical presentation, demographic factors, co-morbidities, current physiological data and those who did not develop complications as a result of fluid administration. By better predicting maintenance fluid requirements based on the previous day's physiological variables, one might be able to prevent hypotensive episodes requiring fluid boluses during the course of the following day.},

Recent developments in the integration and archiving of these data have resulted in new opportunities for data analysis and clinical feedback. New problems associated with ICU databases have also arisen. ICU data are high-dimensional, often sparse, asynchronous and irregularly sampled, as well as being non-stationary, noisy and subject to frequent exogenous perturbations by clinical staff. Relationships between different physiological parameters are usually nonlinear (except within restricted ranges), and the equipment used to measure the observables is often inherently error-prone and biased. The prior probabilities associated with an individual's genetics, pre-existing conditions, lifestyle and ongoing medical treatment all affect prediction and classification accuracy. In this paper, we describe some of the key problems and associated methods that hold promise for robust parameter extraction and data fusion for use in clinical decision support in the ICU.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Text-based patient medical records are a vital resource in medical research. In order to preserve patient confidentiality, however, the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) requires that protected health information (PHI) be removed from medical records before they can be disseminated. Manual de-identification of large medical record databases is prohibitively expensive, time-consuming and prone to error, necessitating automatic methods for large-scale, automated de-identification.
METHODS: We describe an automated Perl-based de-identification software package that is generally usable on most free-text medical records, e.g., nursing notes, discharge summaries, X-ray reports, etc. The software uses lexical look-up tables, regular expressions, and simple heuristics to locate both HIPAA PHI, and an extended PHI set that includes doctors' names and years of dates. To develop the de-identification approach, we assembled a gold standard corpus of re-identified nursing notes with real PHI replaced by realistic surrogate information. This corpus consists of 2,434 nursing notes containing 334,000 words and a total of 1,779 instances of PHI taken from 163 randomly selected patient records. This gold standard corpus was used to refine the algorithm and measure its sensitivity. To test the algorithm on data not used in its development, we constructed a second test corpus of 1,836 nursing notes containing 296,400 words. The algorithm's false negative rate was evaluated using this test corpus.
RESULTS: Performance evaluation of the de-identification software on the development corpus yielded an overall recall of 0.967, precision value of 0.749, and fallout value of approximately 0.002. On the test corpus, a total of 90 instances of false negatives were found, or 27 per 100,000 word count, with an estimated recall of 0.943. Only one full date and one age over 89 were missed. No patient names were missed in either corpus.
CONCLUSION: We have developed a pattern-matching de-identification system based on dictionary look-ups, regular expressions, and heuristics. Evaluation based on two different sets of nursing notes collected from a U.S. hospital suggests that, in terms of recall, the software out-performs a single human de-identifier (0.81) and performs at least as well as a consensus of two human de-identifiers (0.94). The system is currently tuned to de-identify PHI in nursing notes and discharge summaries but is sufficiently generalized and can be customized to handle text files of any format. Although the accuracy of the algorithm is high, it is probably insufficient to be used to publicly disseminate medical data. The open-source de-identification software and the gold standard re-identified corpus of medical records have therefore been made available to researchers via the PhysioNet website to encourage improvements in the algorithm.},

This study develops patient-specific alarm algorithms in real time. Classification tree and neural network learning were carried out in batch mode on individual patients' vital sign numerics in successive intervals of incremental duration to generate binary classifiers of patient state and thus to determine when to issue an alarm. Results suggest that the performance of these classifiers follows the course of a learning curve. After 8h of patient-specific training during each of 10 monitoring sessions, our neural networks reached average sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and accuracy of 0.96, 0.99, 0.79, and 0.99, respectively. The classification trees achieved 0.84, 0.98, 0.72, and 0.98, respectively. Thus, patient-specific modeling in real time is not only feasible but also effective in generating alerts at the bedside.},

	volume = {42},
	year = {2008},
	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Clinical records contain significant medical information that can be useful to researchers in various disciplines. However, these records also contain personal health information (PHI) whose presence limits the use of the records outside of hospitals. The goal of de-identification is to remove all PHI from clinical records. This is a challenging task because many records contain foreign and misspelled PHI; they also contain PHI that are ambiguous with non-PHI. These complications are compounded by the linguistic characteristics of clinical records. For example, medical discharge summaries, which are studied in this paper, are characterized by fragmented, incomplete utterances and domain-specific language; they cannot be fully processed by tools designed for lay language.
METHODS AND RESULTS: In this paper, we show that we can de-identify medical discharge summaries using a de-identifier, Stat De-id, based on support vector machines and local context (F-measure=97\% on PHI). Our representation of local context aids de-identification even when PHI include out-of-vocabulary words and even when PHI are ambiguous with non-PHI within the same corpus. Comparison of Stat De-id with a rule-based approach shows that local context contributes more to de-identification than dictionaries combined with hand-tailored heuristics (F-measure=85\%). Comparison with two well-known named entity recognition (NER) systems, SNoW (F-measure=94\%) and IdentiFinder (F-measure=36\%), on five representative corpora show that when the language of documents is fragmented, a system with a relatively thorough representation of local context can be a more effective de-identifier than systems that combine (relatively simpler) local context with global context. Comparison with a Conditional Random Field De-identifier (CRFD), which utilizes global context in addition to the local context of Stat De-id, confirms this finding (F-measure=88\%) and establishes that strengthening the representation of local context may be more beneficial for de-identification than complementing local with global context.},

	abstract = {Modern intensive care units (ICUs) employ an impressive array of technologically sophisticated instrumentation to provide detailed measurements of the pathophysiological state of each patient. Providing life support in the ICU is becoming an increasingly complex task, however, because of the growing volume of relevant data from clinical observations, bedside monitors, mechanical ventilators, and a wide variety of laboratory tests and imaging studies. The enormous amount of ICU data and its poor organization makes its integration and interpretation time-consuming and inefficient. There is a critical need to integrate the disparate clinical information into a single, rational framework and to provide the clinician with hypothesis-driven displays that succinctly summarize a patient's trajectory over time. In this paper, we present our recent efforts towards the development of such an advanced patient monitoring system that aims to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and timeliness of clinical decision making in intensive care.},

	abstract = {To facilitate and survey studies in automatic de-identification, as a part of the i2b2 (Informatics for Integrating Biology to the Bedside) project, authors organized a Natural Language Processing (NLP) challenge on automatically removing private health information (PHI) from medical discharge records. This manuscript provides an overview of this de-identification challenge, describes the data and the annotation process, explains the evaluation metrics, discusses the nature of the systems that addressed the challenge, analyzes the results of received system runs, and identifies directions for future research. The de-indentification challenge data consisted of discharge summaries drawn from the Partners Healthcare system. Authors prepared this data for the challenge by replacing authentic PHI with synthesized surrogates. To focus the challenge on non-dictionary-based de-identification methods, the data was enriched with out-of-vocabulary PHI surrogates, i.e., made up names. The data also included some PHI surrogates that were ambiguous with medical non-PHI terms. A total of seven teams participated in the challenge. Each team submitted up to three system runs, for a total of sixteen submissions. The authors used precision, recall, and F-measure to evaluate the submitted system runs based on their token-level and instance-level performance on the ground truth. The systems with the best performance scored above 98\% in F-measure for all categories of PHI. Most out-of-vocabulary PHI could be identified accurately. However, identifying ambiguous PHI proved challenging. The performance of systems on the test data set is encouraging. Future evaluations of these systems will involve larger data sets from more heterogeneous sources.},

Some of our categories, e.g., test results and findings, include complex entries that span multiple phrases.

Fees range very widely, from $2-55 for short records of 15 pages to $15-585 for long ones of 500 pages. Times also range widely, from 1-30 days (or longer for off-site records). A few institutions provide records for free and even fewer make them accessible on-line.

Early detection of epidemics of infectious diseases requires both real-time data and real-time interpretation of data. Despite moderate advancements in data acquisition, the state of the practice for real-time analysis of data remains inadequate. We present a nonlinear mathematical framework for modeling the transient dynamics of influenza, applied to historical data sets of patients with influenza-like illness. We estimate the vital time-varying epidemiological parameters of infections from historical data, representing normal epidemiological trends. We then introduce simulated outbreaks of different shapes and magnitudes into the historical data, and estimate the parameters representing the infection rates of anomalous deviations from normal trends. Finally, a dynamic threshold-based detection algorithm is devised to assess the timeliness and sensitivity of detecting the irregularities in the data, under a fixed low false-positive rate. We find that the detection algorithm can identify such designated abnormalities in the data with high sensitivity with specificity held at 97\%, but more importantly, early during an outbreak. The proposed methodology can be applied to a broad range of influenza-like infectious diseases, whether naturally occurring or a result of bioterrorism, and thus can be an integral component of a real-time surveillance system.},

The Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center recently implemented a proof-of-concept, Web-based, cross-institutional medical record, CareWeb, which incorporates the NRC security and confidentiality recommendations. We report on our WWW implementation of the NRC recommendations and an initial evaluation of the balance between ease of use and confidentiality.},

This paper describes an explicit protocol that would make it possible to electronically identify patients and providers, secure permission for release of records, and track information that is transmitted. It is hoped that other, similar efforts now underway will be able to use and build on this model. Comment on this proposal is invited from all parties with an interest in confidentiality. The system will be used only with ``scrubbed'' data-data from which all identifiers have been removed-until it is generally agreed that the confidentiality methods proposed here are appropriate and sufficient.},

JAMI inherited several design decisions from the first W3-EMRS implementation described in, including using the Web as the communication infrastructure and HL7 as the communication protocol between the heterogeneous systems and the W3-EMRS systems. In addition, JAMI incorporates the growing Java technologies and has a more flexible and efficient architecture. This paper describes JAMI's architecture and implementation. It also present two instances of JAMI, one for the integration of different hospital information systems and another for the integration of two heterogeneous systems within a single hospital. Some important issues for the further development of JAMI, including security and confidentiality, data input and decision support are discussed.}}

Unique system designs coupled with a lack of standards have led to this difficulty. The authors have designed a preliminary EMRS architecture (W3-EMRS) that exploits the multiplatform, multiprotocol, client-server technology of the World Wide Web. The architecture abstracts the clinical information model and the visual presentation away from the underlying EMRS. As a result, computation upon data elements of the EMRS and their presentation are no longer tied to the underlying EMRS structures. The architecture is intended to enable implementation of programs that provide uniform access to multiple, heterogeneous legacy EMRSs. The authors have implemented an initial prototype of W3-EMRS that accesses the database of the Boston Children's Hospital Clinician's Workstation.},

It then reviews simple Bayesian formulations of the problem and pursues the generalization to the Bayesian network methods that are popular today. Decision making is presented from the decision analysis viewpoint, with brief mention of recently-developed methods. The paper concludes with review of more abstract characterization of uncertainty, and anticipates the growing importance of analytic and ``data mining'' techniques as growing amounts of clinical data become widely available.}}

Hopes that such a strategy would lead to clinically useful programs have not been fulfilled, but many of the problems impeding creation of effective artificial intelligence programs have been solved. Strategies have been developed to limit the number of hypotheses that a program must consider and to incorporate pathophysiologic reasoning. The latter innovation permits a program to analyze cases in which one disorder influences the presentation of another. Prototypes embodying such reasoning can explain their conclusions in medical terms that can be reviewed by the user. Despite these advances, further major research and developmental efforts will be necessary before expert performance by the computer becomes a reality.},
